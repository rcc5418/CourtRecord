Athena:<br />
It's complete chaos outside.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's just say the Defiant Dragons supporters demonstrating for Dhurke's freedom... ...have taken a very special interest in the outcome of today's trial.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
They look about ready to string us up if we lose...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Trials here are pretty much like the ones back home, but with one major difference: The Divination Séance. The victim's final memories will become a matter for deliberation.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I've heard about that. But they haven't stopped you from winning your cases here in Khura'in.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
True, but it wasn't easy. Still, the memories of the dead are simply another piece of evidence. There's always a way to deal with them if your client is truly innocent.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, I know Dhurke is innocent, but...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dhurke:<br />
I have one more... big <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dhurke:<br />
Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with <span style="color:#E16935">a truth that is difficult to accept</span>. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke... What is that secret you're keeping?)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
Heya, AJ.
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Here ya go, just like I promised.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Founder's Orb added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Thanks, Datz. Wait... Weren't you arrested by the police yesterday?
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Yep. And I spent the night in the slammer. I had a fine meal, a shower -- even a bed! What more could I ask for? Har har har har!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That actually sounds way better than where we're staying...
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Just remember, AJ, if Dhurke's found guilty today... ...we'll all probably be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act, too.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yeah, Nahyuta said something to that effect.)</span>
</p><p>Datz:<br />
That witch Ga'ran wants to take advantage of today to crush our revolution once and for all! The fate of the revolution -- and every Khura'inese person -- rests on this trial! We're counting on ya, AJ!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
We'll be fine! I'm going to win this one. You'll see!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The trial will begin shortly, Apollo. Let's make our way into the courtroom.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Right!

<center><b>Day 1<br />Court Is Now In Session<br />All Rise</b></center>
<p>Judge:<br />
Let the trial of Dhurke Sahdmadhi begin.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The prosecution is ready, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...So it's really come down to this. Well, don't expect me to hold anything back, Nahyuta!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This trial will examine both <span style="color:#E16935">the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in</span>... ...and <span style="color:#E16935">the assassination of the former queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in</span>. First, I believe we should address the murder of Minister Inga. Would that be acceptable, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
........................
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
! Y-Yes, of course. Please proceed.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What's with him?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How very unlike you, prosecutor. Is your mind elsewhere this day?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...N-Not at all, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Are you really going to be able to go through with this, Nahyuta...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, I would be remiss if I failed to voice a concern of mine. I have heard mention that you are son to the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........You have heard true. Does that fact pose some sort of a problem, Your Magistry?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A father being prosecuted by his own son? Could one possibly deliberate such a case without having personal feelings intervene?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........Yes, without question.
</p><p>Gallery:
</p>
<center>Can he really handle this?<br />Even if it IS Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, going against his own father is just...<br />How can the son of a criminal even BE a prosecutor in the first place?</center>

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke...?)</span>
</p><p>Dhurke:<br />
...Fellow citizens, you would do well not to underestimate my son. He's not one to allow personal feelings to interfere with the execution of his duty. Isn't that right, Nahyuta?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...! ...I will not stop until my work here is done.
</p><p>Dhurke:<br />
See? So all you doubters just sit back down before you trip over your own stupidity! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The accused will not take the stand without first being summoned! In any case, if Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has no issue with this arrangement... ...then let us commence the deliberations.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
One moment, if you would.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Your Eminence?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Your Eminence! What brings you here?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Your Magistry. It would appear that Prosecutor Shadmadhi does indeed have some reservations.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
No! That's not true!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Did you truly believe you could deceive me... Nahyuta Sahdmadhi? One should hold no reservations if one is to stand on these hallowed funerary grounds.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I-I... I have none, Your Emine--
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
No, it is clear we cannot leave this matter to you.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Nngh!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
We shall handle the prosecution of Enemy of the Crown Dhurke Sahdmadhi personally. But remain by our side, and bear witness to how a true prosecutor enforces the law.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Um... Excuse me... but is the queen going to prosecute the case? Is that you know... um... kosher?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...There is no need for concern. Before we were crowned queen, we served as a prosecutor.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Really?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As a foreigner, your ignorance can be excused, but know this... The prosecutor in charge of the Queen Amara assassination case twenty-three years ago... ... was none other than Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(First, "Your Magistry," and now this... Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things...?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'd heard she'd served as the Minister of Justice, but she was also a prosecutor?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm guessing she probably moved up the ladder from prosecutor to Justice Minister.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
We prosecuted that case twenty-three years ago, but no verdict was ever rendered. We had won guilty verdicts in every case until then, for no lawyer could stand up to us.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ahh, I am at a loss for words. To think I would once more bear witness to Her Eminence at work in the Hall of Justice.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
......... Our first trial in twenty-three years... No quarter shall be given to criminals. We shall prosecute them with all our might!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gallery:
</p>
<center>...Ohhh!<br />What a magnificent sight!<br />The queen's attire from her prosecutor days! To think we would get to see it once more!</center>
<p>Apollo:<br />
What the--?! TH-THAT'S Queen Ga'ran?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Talk about an extreme makeover.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Heh heh heh. It's all coming back now. The feel of my blood pumping through my veins. Woe to you, O enemies of Khura'in, for I shall personally slice, dice... ...and grind you up into hog feed!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't suppose I can ask her to roll back to her polite, pre-makeover personality...)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Know this, lawyer.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Now that I stand as prosecutor, consider your defense's bench a headsman's scaffold. If you wish to leave any last words, I advise you to start thinking of them now. ...While you still have a head with which to think, that is.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Meep. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Sh-She's dead serious.)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Now, it is time for the Divination Séance. Rayfa, come forth.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your Benevolence, thank you for gracing us with your presence.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
........................
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Your Benevolence? I understand it may be difficult for you, but... ...may we proceed with the Divination Séance?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
............Yes, let us proceed.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Forgive me for asking, but are you feeling physically unwell? If so, I would advise you to avoid any undue exertion.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Um-hmm.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Your Benevolence?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What's wrong? It's like her mind's anywhere but here.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A lot's happened since yesterday. On top of the murder of her beloved father, she found out that he'd been planning a coup. And today she'll have to experience his death through his own eyes.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah... That would be enough to shake anyone up.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Still, it seems like she's worse off today than she was yesterday.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...............
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yeah... I don't remember her being this depressed...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ga'ran:<br />
...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait... Ga'ran didn't do something to her, did she?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your Eminence, about today's Divination Séance... As I understand it, the prosecution has yet to review its content. Is this deviation from protocol a part of your plan?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Would you care to explain your actions?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Your Eminence... The accused was caught at the scene of the crime. Therefore, I deemed no Séance would be necessary for such a clear-cut case.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...You and your bleeding heart. You seek to spare Rayfa the trauma of witnessing her father's death... Is that why you have done this?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...N-Not at all.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........You were concerned for me, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? 
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's oddly compassionate of him, all things considered.)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Your Eminence, Your Magistry. Regardless of what is best for Her Benevolence... ...this case is blessed with a bounty of incontrovertible evidence. So I believed we can reach a swift verdict without devoting precious time to a Séance.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... You have a point. Personally, I would like to spare Her Benevolence any undue misery. Experiencing the murder of a loved one is a burden no one should have to bear.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Your Magistry. Can this trial truly proceed without a Divination Séance?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't blame her for not wanting to experience her father's murder firsthand...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your Eminence? What are your feelings on the matter? Shall we have Her Benevolence return home for some much-needed rest?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
.........We shall not. You fools spoil her with your feckless words of compassion.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Ngh...
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Listen well, Rayfa. You have spoken time and time again about how grown up you are now.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Y-Yes, but...
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
So, let us see if the royal priestess has truly come into her own. Are you prepared to fulfill your duty and perform the Divination Séance as you should?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.....................Yes.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
That's better. See. Problem solved.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Poor Rayfa. Is this really a good idea?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I guess we'll see...
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...Very well. Let us begin... the Divination Séance. Nayna, my robe... .........Oh.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Looks like Nayna's still missing.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's been a whole day already.)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Barbed Head.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
You remove my robe.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What?! Why me?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Don't keep Her Benevolence waiting now, Mr. Wright. Can't you see she's ready to begin?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Great. I've been reduced to "royal robe remover."
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's like she's grooming Mr. Wright to be Nayna's replacement...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, Your Benevolence. Please start when you are ready.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Ngh...
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Come, Rayfa. You know what must be done. There is no turning back now.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
..................I know.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The final memories of the deceased... This should be interesting.)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
O Holy Mother! We hold this <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séance</span> in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their <span style="color:#E16935">final memories</span> in the <span style="color:#E16935">Pool of Souls</span>!
</p>

<p>Rayfa:<br />
Haggh! I. I... I... Ah... Auunngh!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />

</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.................. *huff, puff* *huff, puff* .........*gasp!*
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Y-Your Benevolence! Wh-What's wrong?!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Th-This is... unacceptable!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-Bailiff! Take Her Benevolence to the first-aid station at once!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
This is not good...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
....Your Eminence, do you have any idea why Her Benevolence collapsed so suddenly?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...It seems she was not ready for what the deceased was to reveal. It overwhelmed her. Her inexperience and immaturity left her ill-prepared to face her father's death. Hmph. And she said she could go through with it. How very disappointing. 
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I know someone who's not winning "Mother of the Yeah," ever. I mean, of course Rayfa's going to be overwhelmed. She's still just a child!)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...It seems we have no choice but to move on to witness testimony. Your Magistry?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, yes. Let us proceed. Bailiff, summon the first witness, if you would.

<p>Judge:<br />
Is this not the accused?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
It is indeed. I thought I would give him the opportunity to plead his case. For true justice is more than a unilateral presentation of the facts by the prosecution.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That seems uncharacteristically fair of her.)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
However, should the accused fail to produce convincing testimony... ...he, along with his cabal of traitorous lawyers, shall immediately be found guilty... ...and their heads will roll from their shoulders.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
WHAAAAAAT?! I should've known there was a catch!
</p><p>Dhurke:<br />
Your court, your rules -- same as it always was, I see, Ga'ran.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, then, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi. If you could enlighten us as to what happened?
</p><p>Dhurke:<br />
Um, well... I would... if I could...

I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.<br />
The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.<br />
And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.<br />
I've no recollection of what happened in the interim.<br />
But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
............ <span style="color:#0070C0">(That didn't explain squat.)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
For the record, let it be known... ... that the accused's fingerprints were all over the murder weapon. And since he was caught in the act, there was no chance for a third party to tamper with it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, that certainly seems to point the finger at you, Mr. Sahdmadhi.
</p><p>Dhurke:<br />
Even as a lawyer, I have to agree with you there, Your Magistry. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Seriously, Dhurke? This is no laughing matter.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This is exactly what Ga'ran wanted. To have Dhurke try to plead his case, only to fail miserably.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
How low can she go...?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Prosecutor, behold this most unpleasant of spectacles and let it be etched into your soul. See how instead of accepting the inevitable... ...those fish-brained lawyers flounder and flop themselves straight into the abyss of despair.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes, Your Eminence! Show me the way!

The bloodstain belongs to the real killer, of course. Whoever it was, they were probably shot while they were attacking Minister Inga. And since their blood would give them away, they had to wipe it up. And I say this because we know for a fact that the justice minister fired his gun in the tomb.

There's one place no one would search, not even the queen's royal guard. And that would be... Inside Queen Aamara's sarcophagus. Even now, it's locked up tight.

Here you are, Your Eminence!

The police have already identified the source of the bloodstain. The DNA test revealed... ...that the blood is of the traitor, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?! But Dhurke wasn't injured. So where did his blood come from?

The key to Amara's sarcophagus is under the protection of the royal family. My husband and I are the only ones who could open it. Therefore, it would be impossible for some knave to open it.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Can I really discount the sarcophagus as a hiding place, though? What if the real killer is still in there? ...No, that's just ridiculous.)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />

So this is why Ga'ran allowed us to cross-examine Dhurke. By establishing his guilt in Inga's murder... ...she's effectively damaged his reputation among those who support him.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
True, but now we have an even bigger problem.

And now, filthy lawyers, you will honor your end of the bargain. Accept your guilty verdict for your failure to explain your client's actions.

Umm... Dhurke became the prime suspect... ...because it didn't seem probable that there was a third party at the scene of the crime. But there is another question we should ask ourselves at this time. Was Minister Inga really killed after Dhurke entered the tomb?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
......... What nonsense is this?

It's like one of those Zen riddles. I saw a show about them on TV the other day. They're questions or stories that can't be explained using logic. But continual meditation on the illogical can lead to enlightenment. A famous example is, "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...I have a better question, defense. What is the sound of one penalty landing?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oww!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Better save those riddles for later, Apollo.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
L-Let me try that again, Your Magistry!

<p>Apollo:<br />
Isn't it possible that... ...before Dhurke even set foot in the tomb, Minister Inga was already dead?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That would certainly make the possibility of a third party more probable.
</p><p>Dhurke:<br />
...Why, of course. I fell unconscious right after I entered the tomb. Even if I hadn't, I wouldn't have had a clear line of sight to his body from the entrance. Which means...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...You wouldn't have noticed his body either way. This scenario is entirely possible. And so we can't rule out the possibility of a third person committing the crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......I see... Well, that certainly does make sense.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So far, so good... This might actually work!)</span>

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes!)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Let us hear some testimony that will shed light on when exactly the minister was slain. Bailiff, summon Rayfa. Surely she has recovered by now.
</p><p>Judge:<br />

<p>Judge:<br />
I hope you are feeling better, Your Benevolence.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Must I perform the Divination Séance?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What? ...Oh, no, no. We merely require your testimony this time.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
............... ...How could my testimony be of any value?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your Benevolence?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Princess Rayfa seems awfully depressed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
After what she's been through, summoning her again is like rubbing salt in the wound. Being unable to perform the Séance was probably the last straw.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I hope she doesn't pass out again.)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, may I ask you something?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Of course, Your Benevolence.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I, um... I've been meaning to ask you this since yesterday. Did you know about... ...Queen Amara... ...and... about me?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
! From where did you hear such a thing...?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
From Mother... and only yesterday.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the "truth" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...I see. Be as it may, Your Benevolence, it has no bearing upon our trial here today. So, there is no need to let it trouble you.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...I know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Ga'ran told Rayfa about something other than Amara's status?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Sounds like it, but what could it be?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Rayfa, the defense has proposed something preposterous. They somehow think your father was already dead when Dhurke entered the tomb. But I believe you can prove them wrong. Are you prepared to do what is required of you?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
..................Yes. I am ready to testify.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, then, Your Benevolence. Your testimony, if you please...

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- What Rayfa Witnessed --</span></center>
<p>Rayfa:<br />
On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda.<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Around 2:30 PM</span>, I saw my father heading for Amara's Tomb.<br />
Then, at <span style="color:#E16935">about 2:45</span>, I saw Barbed Head and company enter the courtyard.<br />
I saw <span style="color:#E16935">no one go in or out of the tomb after</span> my father entered at about <span style="color:#E16935">2:30</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
Your second-floor veranda? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, she must be talking about that house facing Inga's private residence.)</span> So that's the location from which you saw your father? And at about 2:30?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes. And shortly after that, you people arrived at the royal residence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, after the minister entered Amara's Tomb at around 2:30... ...no one went in or out of there until the murder was discovered?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
The tomb is closed to outsiders, so no one could have snuck in before the murder. That rules out any possibility of a third party lying in wait to slay my poor husband.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Or so she'd like us to believe.)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Now hear me, you useless lawyer. Cease this charade and bow before me. For I, Queen Ga'ran, shall finally have your head!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nngh...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Forgive me, Your Eminence, but first, let us allow the defense to question the witness.

There was?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes, a shriek emanated from within my father's quarters... ...after which I witnessed him bolt outside, his countenance drained of its usual color.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
He screamed and he was looking pale? What do you suppose happened?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I know not. Perhaps he had a bad dream.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Maybe it was a nightmare about being raked over the coals by the queen.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
2:45... Yes, I believe that's around when we arrived. Mr. Wright, Athena, Dhurke, and I were running toward the tomb.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes. I was taken aback, as we don't normally see commoners in the palace courtyard. Even more shocking was that Dhurke -- a wanted man -- was with you.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah, I suppose so.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I thought the villainous leader of the Defiant Dragons was here with his minions... ...because it was, you know, "time for a revolution."
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I think you've been watching too much of that TV show.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I have already banned its broadcast for containing content unsuitable for our kingdom. Besides, the actress playing Rayfa looked nothing like her. I can't have my subjects feeling so... disappointed when they see the real Rayfa.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
M-Mother...! Why are you so cruel to me?! Are you so ashamed?! Once I am all grown up, I shall be just as full-figured as that actress!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
She's placing all her hopes on one final growth spurt.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

Oooh... I'll show you! I shall double my milk intake and grow up big and strong!

There there, Your Benevolence. I think you are fine, just the way you are. Now, may I ask that you continue with your testimony?

Ooh. Noooooooooooo!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Please, Your Benevolence, tell us what you REALLY saw!

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Hmph. Do not heed their lies. Lawyers are a foul breed, quick to claim that a third party is to blame for a crime. ...Nayna did not enter the tomb, that much is certain.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
How can you be so sure?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
When Nayna's hat was stolen... ...that crazed cur spilled an urn full of water upon my husband's doorstep. Is that not right, Rayfa?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes. Yes, it is. While that dingbat dog was tugging on Nayna's hat, it tipped over the urn. 
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
The bottoms of her shoes would have been soaked with water. And if she had truly headed into the tomb with wet shoes... ...she would have left shoeprints along the way. But the only shoeprints to be found belonged to my husband, Inga.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh? Th-Then...
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
How do you know?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right! Edgeworth and I did see some shoeprints in there.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Now do you understand? Nayna could not have possibly have gone into the tomb. And that supposed third person at the crime scene is but a figment of your imagination.

Argh.

I'd say... there's no way that the body was moved. After all, there was an awful lot of blood in the tomb.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I understand if the scream was in reaction to Nayna's attack... But Inga died in the tomb.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...We need to explain how those two realities could coincide. <span style="color:#0070C0">(How are we supposed to do that?)</span> ............... Oh, maybe... Maybe where he was stabbed and where he died were two completely different locations.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...What do you mean?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It's just, let's look at this as simply as possible. If the minister's body wasn't moved... ...he might've been <span style="color:#E16935">stabbed by Nayna in his private quarters</span>... ...but then <span style="color:#E16935">died in the tomb</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm? ...............Hrrmm, I see. On the one hand, that seems plausible, but on the other, it seems decidedly implausible. 
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what is that fool babbling on about now? Is this a riddle from one of those "fortune cookies" Americans seems so fond of?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Perhaps. But I believe he himself does not know what he means to say. In all likelihood, it was a poor attempt to confuse us. We should simply ignore him.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I wasn't finished yet, so hold off on the analysis, would you? The autopsy report <span style="color:#E16935">never stated that the minister's death was instantaneous</span>. So, he could have conceivably <span style="color:#E16935">moved from one place to another after being stabbed</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, my! Are you...?! Are you suggesting he ran all the way to the tomb with a knife sticking out of his back?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Well, yes, that's the gist of it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
In short, Minister Inga saw Nayna with a knife... ...let out a scream, and when he turned his back to her to flee...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Right. And that's when he was stabbed from behind. Well, Your Magistry? Does my theory hold water?

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Your Eminence. Hah!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............N-Nahyuta? 
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You dull, slow-witted, putrid minded lawyer. Perhaps YOU would be too stupid to notice you had been stabbed in the back... ...but a normal person would have noticed due to the <span style="color:#E16935">excruciating pain</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
N-Now hold on...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Allow me to teach you the meaning of pain! Hrnh!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! P-Please stoooooooooooop!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Nahyuta has a point. Normally, most people would notice a dagger in their back.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Owwww... Yeah, I doubt someone could ignore pain like this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Still, in this case, it's the word "normally" that we should emphasize. Apollo, take another look at the Court Record.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
R-Right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(There must be something that explains this.)</span> There's a reason Inga didn't feel any pain. And the defense will submit evidence proving just that!

And how would that prevent the victim from experiencing pain?

"Why didn't Justice Minister Inga notice that he had been stabbed?"
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Rayfa:<br />
Ahh! Th-Those are my father's painkiller shots!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defense will explain the significance of this evidence.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Minister Inga suffered from terrible back pain, so he often injected himself with these. We're told that one shot in the back would make all his pain go away. With this, it's easy to explain what happened! Don't tell me you didn't know about these, Your Eminence?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
! You can't mean...?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Minister Inga was stabbed in his back, close to where he usually injected the painkiller. Therefore... It's entirely possible that he hadn't noticed that he'd been stabbed!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Wha--?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What's this...?! Then, then...! Are you suggesting Justice Minister Inga really ran off with a knife protruding from his back?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I am, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
So then, when I saw my father, he had a knife sticking out of him? I mean, with that cape of his, I couldn't see his back very well...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, the knife was there. I was just plunged in so deep, you didn't notice it under the cape. Therefore, when you saw your father... he was already "dead"... ...murdered by Nayna in his private quarters!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
H-Holy Mother of Khura'in! Are we dealing with the living dead here?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, technically, he wasn't dead yet.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I know it's hard to believe, but this is a plausible sequence of events. And once Minister Inga arrived at the tomb... ...he could have removed the knife, and dropped dead from blood loss!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Nayna killed my father...? There must be some mistake.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The defense would like to call Nayna to the stand!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
You seek to drag an innocent old woman to the stand with no proof whatsoever?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
W-Well... there's no real proof, but...
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Hmph. What a tangled web of expedient lies you weave.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........I can no longer tell fact from fiction. Who or what shall I believe in now?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm sorry, Rayfa. All I've done is confuse you. But... I have a sneaking suspicion Nayna's involved in this case one way or another.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Just when I thought we'd blown this case wide open...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Well, there's no turning back now.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
.........You fool of a lawyer. I know why you are so desperate to prove the accused innocent.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You do?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Yes, because he faces public execution if proven guilty... ...as shall you, under the stipulations of the Defense Culpability Act. From the moment you accepted this case, you have had no choice but to fight for your lives.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...No. The simple fact is I've always believed that Dhurke is innocent.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Bah! Still you cling to your pretense? ...Very well, I shall offer you a bargain. If you would admit that the accused is guilty, right here, right now... ...I shall overlook your crime of abetting him, and you will not be subject to execution.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Is this some sort of joke?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Far from it. As queen, I have the power to grant pardons, even to criminals like you. And with the wave of my hand, I can even reduce the severity of a sentence. ...Perhaps even for Dhurke, should you be willing to cooperate.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
She wasn't kidding when she said that she's the law here. But to flaunt that power in our faces like that? That's just wrong.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Forget all that has transpired in our kingdom, and return to your own country in peace. Well? Will you abandon your defense of the accused and accept my generous offer?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If I don't take this deal, we'll be executed along with Dhurke if he's found guilty. What should I do?)</span>

</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Y-You... You nincompoops! You'll die if you lose this case! Why would you even entertain the notion of continuing?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I believe that Dhurke is innocent. That's why. And besides, trials exist to give the truth a chance to get out into the open. You can't give up just because you're afraid of some punishment.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Even if that punishment is death? Does that not frighten you, Horn Head?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Who wouldn't be scared? I mean, just thinking about it... ...makes me weak in the knees, to be honest. But as a lawyer, I have a <span style="color:#E16935">duty</span> to protect my client. I can't just abandon that.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />

</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Am I... prepared? ...Prepared to fulfill my duty?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Isn't a Divination Séance required at all trials, anyway? If so, I imagine there'd be a problem with handing down a verdict without one.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Indeed. It would be problematic. Under Khura'inese law, a Séance must be conducted before a verdict can be rendered.

Rayfa, do not be fooled by his lawyerly guile. You are not prepared to witness your father's death.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...........................But... Horn Head needs my help.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Rayfa, did you not tell me earlier? Did you not tell me you were prepared? But despite your grandiose posturing, you collapsed in a most piteous fashion.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Ngh.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Even worse, you have erred in your Insights of late. For has not the Barbed One there overturned them more than once?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Ooh...
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
You cannot be trusted to keep your word, nor can you reveal the truth through your Insights. So, I say to you -- begone! This sacred Hall of Justice has no need for such a worthless royal priestess.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
W-W-W... Worthless?

Um, Her Benevolence says she can do it, doesn't she? So I don't see why you have to condemn her before she's even made the attempt.

I said, no, Mother! For I am the Royal Priestess of Khura'in!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I have no need for you now!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Even if you do not need me, Mother... ...Horn Head and this Hall of Justice do! He proved that to me by risking his own life! It is because of him that I now understand! The Divination Séance is my sacred duty! I must fulfill it, no matter the risk!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Your Benevolence...
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Mother taught me that the Divination Séance was a mirror reflecting naught but the truth. But I began to have my doubts after Barbed Head disproved the Insights it offered. And now, I don't even know who or what to trust anymore. Father, Mother, even Nayna... I had believed in them above all others. But... I finally know now. I know in what I can trust. The royal priestess must debate each Séance with the presiding lawyer and prosecutor... ...so that it can be interpreted properly. That is how I believe trials here in Khura'in should function. Therefore, the Hall of Justice needs me. It is my power that leads trials toward the truth. That is my sacred duty, and I will never shirk from it again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That right there, Your Benevolence... ...is the product of what you've learned in your struggles so far... ...the truth that you realized with your own strength.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
As my sacred duty, I musst ensure that it is fulfilled. I must have the courage and resolve to see it through!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Your Eminence, the royal priestess says she will conduct the Divination Séance. I see no grounds for you to forbid it... ...unless, of course, you are worried that it might reveal something you find inconvenient.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
.........
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Mother! I am done letting you have your way!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
.........Rayfa, you would actually rebel against me? Your mother and queen?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Though I am scared to see my father's death... ...I must face my fear! That... is what Horn Head has taught me here today.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

Y-Yes, there can be no mistake. That was what my father himself witnessed.

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
.........Ho ho ho. I think we're done here, lawyer.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
How so?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
You claimed that Minister Inga was stabbed in his private quarters... ...and, feeling no pain, went to the tomb, where he eventually fell dead. But this Séance vision proves he was stabbed in the tomb, and felt great pain, no less.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh. That.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Therefore, as I asserted all along... ...it was the accused who stabbed the minister in the tomb!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ack! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Everything just backfired... big time...!)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wow... Ga'ran has the devil's own luck, doesn't she?

At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.<br />
He was drinking grape juice while gazing upon the picture of the Holy Mother.<br />
He had been waiting vigilantly, when suddenly, he heard Dhurke's voice.<br />
The next moment, he was stabbed in the back and collapsed.<br />
My father tried to shoot his attacker, but he missed, and the attacker let out a laugh.

Your Benevolence, there seems to be an inconsistency in your interpretation.

An inconsistency? Where?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Minister Inga is far too relaxed for what was supposedly about to take place. When he heard the voice you claim is Dhurke's... ...he didn't seem the least bit alarmed. He just kept looking at the picture of the founder.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's strange, right? He was waiting for Dhurke to arrive with the Founder's Orb... ...but when he heard that voice, he didn't even turn to look. Don't you think he would've been worried about being attacked from behind?

A lion's roar could be heard over the phone. Don't you find that strange? You claimed the call was with someone at the palace. But let me ask you: Do you keep lions there?

No. The only animals at the palace are little birdies and my pet frog.

I believe there's a contradiction here, while the rest of you don't. So, who is right and who is wrong?

...It's quite simple really. There's is already a Mr. Wright, so you must be Mr. Wrong.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Is this any way to treat Justice, Your Magistry?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apollo, since we now know that the loud bang came from a firecracker... ...there's something that Rayfa said that no longer lines up with reality. Something that will destroy a major assumption about this case.

<p>Judge:<br />
Ahlbi Ur'gaid's statement... again?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes. Because to summarize what he said... ...<span style="color:#E16935">at around 2 PM</span>, Shah'do was surprised by a firecracker and ran into the palace courtyard.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Around... 2 PM?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's right. <span style="color:#E16935">2 PM</span>. Not 3 PM.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Are you suggesting...?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I think you know where I'm going with this. <span style="color:#E16935">Datz's laugh</span>, the <span style="color:#E16935">cry of the warbaa'd</span>... ...and the <span style="color:#E16935">bang of the firecracker</span> were all heard right before Minister Inga's death. Thanks to Ahlbi's statement, we can put a definitive timestamp on all of these sounds. Therefore... ...what this vision shows is that it's extremely likely that the deceased's final moments... ...were at <span style="color:#E16935">2</span>, rather than 3, as we had originally thought.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
D-Dare I ask...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It means the murder took place... ...<span style="color:#E16935">a full hour before</span> Dhurke entered the tomb!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Arngh! ...H-How can this be?! Are you saying that I, the very personification of the law, have been mistaken?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Heh. Now you see why Justice will always prevail!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Peace! Peace, I say! ...Now then, defense. I must remind you that the figure of the accused was clearly shown in the vision. How do you explain that?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I wouldn't say it was CLEARLY shown. After all, the figure didn't actually have a face.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Ah! You are absolutely right. Without a face, we can't be certain of who it was.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Furthermore, need I remind you that if the vision is from 2 PM... ...Dhurke was still with me and Mr. Wright. Which means this faceless figure... couldn't possibly be him!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So then, what are we to make of this one hour difference?!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Wait! T-Two o'clock...? That's when... ...my mother was performing the Rite of Channeling.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...! Th-The palace guards had all been reassigned to guard the channeling chamber for the rite. Don't tell me...!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
The royal residence... it would have been virtually unguarded.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Which means the real killer could have easily slipped unseen into Amara's Tomb.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense! Are you saying... ...that this is someone disguised as the accused?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's exactly what I believe, Your Magistry.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Preposterous. Disguises cannot deceive the memories of the dead. That the face did not appear this time is mere happenstance. Had it appeared, such subterfuge would have been as clear as day!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's got a point there. Anyone who knows about the Divination Séance would've tried to hide their face. Nevertheless, our killer openly appeared before Inga. The question is, why?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
.........Apollo. Maybe the killer could afford to be so bold... ...because they knew their face wouldn't show up in the Séance vision.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's possible that the killer dared to dress in Dhurke's clothes... ...and stand square in front of Inga...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...precisely because they knew they could get away with it. But how could anyone be so sure of something like that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A long time ago, I heard of a cognitive disorder... ...that impairs a person's ability to distinguish between different faces. What if Inga had it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Then, are you saying that this is literally how Inga saw the world?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes. We can't normally see through the eyes of others, but in this case, we can. And if he had that disorder, I imagine this is how faces appeared to him in life.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Okay, let's say that the killer knew that Inga had such a disorder. They could definitely use it to pin the crime on Dhurke. But...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If you're wondering about how to prove that Inga had it, you already have what you need.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Really?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, defense? Do you have anything to show to this court?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Y-Yes... I believe so. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Frankly, I have no idea what Mr. Wright means, but I'll look the evidence over again.)</span>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Judge:<br />
A notepad?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes. It was found in Minister Inga's room... ...and it holds the answer we're looking for. As you can see, it's filled with detailed notes on various individuals. What kind of clothes they wear, hairstyles, and other discerning <span style="color:#E16935">physical characteristics</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And this is connected to the faceless nature of the killer how...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The vision we saw was exactly what Minister Inga saw with his own eyes. It is he who saw his killer as a person without a face. In fact, this is how he normally saw everyone around him.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What's this?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I believe Minister Inga had a disorder that prevented him from recognizing faces. It would explain the faceless being... ...and why he needed a notepad full of people's physical characteristics.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........Now that I think about it... ...my father was always terrible at remembering people. By simply changing my hair style, he would fail to recognize even me.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Your Eminence. You knew that your husband had such a disorder, didn't you?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
........................ ...He never wished for it to become public knowledge... ...but I suppose there is no use in keeping quiet about it now. It is as you say. My late husband had a special disorder that hindered his ability to recognize faces. The medical term for it is <span style="color:#E16935">prosopagnosia</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So Mr. Wright was right!)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
The memories of those afflicted with such disorders in life do appear strange at times. There is precedence for this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So the killer likely knew about the disorder and used it to their advantage.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Right, so they're someone who is both knoowledgeable about the <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séance</span>... ...and aware of <span style="color:#E16935">Inga's affliction</span>. Um, Your Eminence? Who knew about your husband's condition?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
A small number of servants who tended to his needs... ...and me. Surely, you are not about to insinuate that I committed this crime?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, no, Your Eminence. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Still... Could she have done it?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ga'ran has an alibi, remember?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, right... She was conducting the Rite of Channeling at 2 PM. <span style="color:#0070C0">(In that case...)</span> Your Eminence, does Nayna know about Minister Inga's disorder?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Of course she does; she is our head servant.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So as head servant, she knew about Minister Inga's condition... ...and as the princess's personal attendant, she is familiar with the Divination Séance. If these two facts together don't make her a possible suspect... I don't know what would!

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
.........You witless lawyer. How quick you are to forget the facts.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Facts like...?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
When Inga was last seen alive. You claim he was slain at 2, yet that is impossible. For Rayfa saw him at <span style="color:#E16935">2:30</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Ah. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
We DID completely forget about that.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
No, there must be some mistake.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Heh heh heh. So you see, the murder could only have happened at 3 PM... ...the hour Dhurke entered the tomb. There is no other answer to this puzzle.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! Why don't WE ever get to make up answers like Ga'ran makes up laws?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Guess it's back to square one.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-Where did we go wrong?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Hmm... I don't think we're the problem. We just seem to be short one piece of the puzzle. Our deductions so far explain everything to a T. Everything except for <span style="color:#E16935">Inga's sighting at 2:30</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I see. And without that final puzzle piece, all of our deductions fall apart.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apollo, if Inga's sighting is the only anomaly... ...we'll just have to find a way to make it fit into the bigger picture.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Time to think outside the box, then, right? Let's see... It would be impossible to see Inga walking around after he'd been killed. But what if there was <span style="color:#E16935">a way to make people think he was alive</span>, even though he was dead?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Like <span style="color:#E16935">a way to make people witness the living dead</span>?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Sounds like some kind of TV show. Things like that don't happen in real life.)</span> ........................ ...Ah. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A-Apollo! Did you just...?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I did! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I figured it out! I know how to make people witness the living dead!)</span> Your Magistry, our deductions weren't wrong after all. Despite minister Inga being murdered at 2 PM... ...he WAS seen heading into the tomb at 2:30. And I'll tell you how!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
C-Can't anyone take a joke in this country...?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
It was a joke, was it? For shame. You had me truly worried there for a moment.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm fine! And I'm done joking around!

"The "Minister Inga" Her Benevolence saw was, in fact..."
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Apollo:<br />
It was the deceased being channeled. It's the only way a man who was already dead could've been seen by Her Benevolence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ch-Channeled, you say?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's right. And there are only two people capable of spirit channeling here in Khura'in. Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, and Maya Fey. It's possible that one of them was channeling the minister.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
It would seem that you are ever bent on making me party to this crime. Prosecutor, what was I doing at 2:30 PM, the time at which my husband was seen?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Eminence. ...I believe you had completed the channeling rite, and were having tea with... ...the king of the neighboring realm. There would have been many attendants there, too.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Nahyuta has to keep up with her schedule, too? What DOESN'T she make him do?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Then that leaves... only Maya.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah, it does... Maybe someone was forcing her to use her power toward nefarious ends. The real killer could've been threatening her.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Th-That cannot be!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So then, Inga's scream... That was probably from when he "woke up" from being called back to this world. After all, that's when the flow of time would have picked back up for him after he died.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So, Minister Inga probably leapt to his feet, thinking he'd just had a nightmare. Then, realizing it was almost time for the hostage exchange... ...he raced off to Amara's Tomb, not even realizing he was already dead.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Th-Then... ...Her Benevolence really did see a dead man running!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...I-I-I... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
U-Using the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit a crime? How can this be...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The defense calls Ms. Maya Fey to the stand!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........Hmm... Well, Your Eminence? Will you allow a new witness?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Hmph, it matters not. Either way, this lawyer shall soon know the truth. He will know just how much of an imbecile he is in the face of my infallible arguments.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Insult me all you want, witch, but you'll be eating those words when I expose the truth!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Let us adjourn until the next witness is ready.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Well, you can't get a closer shave than Headsman's brand blades, that's for sure.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The trial's not even over yet, and I'm already exhausted.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Still, you were able to fight back the queen herself in there.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Well, maybe with Ms. Fey's help, I won't have to keep on playing her game much longer. Speaking of which... I guess it's a little late to be asking, but... ...do you think she's well enough to testify, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
She slept all day yesterday out of exhaustion, apparently... But that's all it was, so she should be okay.
</p><p>???:<br />
Barbed Head, Horn Head.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, hello, Your Benevolence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Princess Rayfa... You were really impressive in there.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Rayfa:<br />
I am the Royal Priestess, Rayfa Padma Khura'in! I am prepared to face my father's death!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
Despite your mother's opposition, you stood your ground. And in doing so, you fulfilled your duty as the royal priestess.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
......... I-It was... It was all thanks to you and your friends. Your belief in me gave me the courage to follow my path. So... um... I... ...You have my gratitude.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, uh... don't mention it.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I know! I shall thank you with a gift. What would you like? A cow? A horse? Or perhaps I shall reward your efforts with a royal shoulder massage.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, uh... That's okay, Your Benevolence. Your gratitude is more than enough. Thanks.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
But I thought you Americans liked massages. My technique was highly praised by my father, I'll have you know.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Hey, you! Lawyers! Where's the accused?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh? Dhurke? .........That's a good question.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Datz?
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Shut up, you!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Um, what's going on?
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
This scoundrel tried to escape with the accused!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Whaaat?!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
We were able to nab him, but the accused is nowhere to be found. Where are you hiding him, you miscreant?!
</p><p>Datz:<br />
I-I keep telling ya, I got no idea where he went! I mean, yeah, we booked it together... ...but I lost track of him after that!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
S-So Dhurke's on the lamb now?
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Probably, but who knows? He vanished in the blink of an eye.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
V-Vanished?
</p><p>Datz:<br />
You wanna know something, AJ? Dhurke said to me... "I can't put Amara in danger. I have to set her free before it's too late."
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-What? Don't tell me he's gone to rescue her!
</p><p>Datz:<br />
But that's what I AM telling ya! It's why I helped him escape in the first place!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Datz! Do you realize what you've done?! .........Well, what's done is done. Still, why'd he choose to go rescue her now?
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Maybe he didn't wanna die with any regrets or something... Ya know, just in case he ended up on the chopping block.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Why, Dhurke...? I thought you believed in me...
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Aww, don't be like that, AJ! He'll be back as soon as he frees Amara. You'll see!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's not the point, Datz...
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Listen, lawyer. You let us know immediately if the accused contacts you! The trial will now resume. See that you are ready!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wait, the trial's still on? Even without the defendant?
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Those were Her Eminence's orders, so you will return to the courtroom at once!

Now then, let us resume the trial at hand.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Um, Your Magistry? My client seems to have gone missing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... What do you think, Your Eminence? Should we proceed without the accused?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Why not? My royal guard is searching for him as we speak. They shall find him soon enough, for they would not dare to keep me waiting.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes, but... what about the law governing court proceedings?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Then I shall simply revise it. As ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: Should the accused be an enemy of the crown... ...they may be tried in absentia.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........Well, in that case, I guess there's no problem with proceeding.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Will the witness, Ms. Maya Fey, please approach the stand?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
Sorry to summon you like this, Maya...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Nnngh... Getting dragged out of bed and into court is not exactly a fun wake-up call, Nick.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm sorry, Ms. Fey. It was my idea.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Hm? And you are...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, right. I'm Apollo Justice. It's nice to finally meet you.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, so you're Apollo! Nick's told me all about you! You're the new guy with the loud voice, and a bit of an unreliable streak, right?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
U-Unreliable...?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Um, well, that was two years ago. You've come a long way since.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
So why was I called here, anyway? .........Um... Am I under arrest again?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I guess no one's filled her in...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, she HAS been asleep this entire time.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ms. Fey, this is a trial for Dhurke Sahdmahdi, <i>[sic]</i> and you're here as a witness.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
What?! D-Dhurke's been... arrested? B-But...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's not exactly the reaction I was expecting...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ms. Fey, you are suspected of playing a part in the murder of Justice Minister Inga.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
What?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Someone allegedly forced you to channel the minister to obfuscate the time of his murder. At least, that is what the defense claims.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Wait... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! How could you, Apollo! How did you even reach that conclusion?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
S-Sorry! But it's the only way this whole case makes any sense.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your understandable anger at the defense aside, will you testify, Ms. Fey?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Y-Yes, Your Magistry...

Besides, I'd never go quietly along with some criminal's plan.<br />
Though, I guess there are some things I'd go quietly along with...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... It seems the witness doesn't believe she has ever channeled Justice Minister Inga.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
And if her words prove to be true, defense, your entire argument becomes moot. You do understand that, don't you?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Y-Yes, of course. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... It doesn't seem like Ms. Fey is lying.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Apollo. Maya was being awfully secretive about something just now.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You've been asleep ever since you were rescued from the tomb, correct?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...Mm-hm. I was exhausted after being held captive for so long.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That must've been terrible.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya, Minister Inga didn't do anything to you, did he?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, no, it wasn't like that. On the contrary, I asked him for all sorts of things.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Like what?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Like "I'm really craving burgers!" and "I'll die if I miss an episode of 'The Plumed Punisher'!" Acting like a brat netted me a TV and even a few burgers from someplace! He was surprisingly nice to me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?! Um... are you sure we're talking about the same guy here?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Hmph. He may have loomed large, but he was unexpectedly easy to push around.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Even though he's the one who was responsible for pushing those execution papers through?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Oh, that? Approving executions was simply his preferred method of stress relief.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(With a wife like her, he was probably really pushing them through out of fear.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm beginning to see why he wanted to stage a coup.

You didn't have a chance to channel him? Does channeling someone take a long time?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Not really. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty much instantaneous. But I was all tied up, literally! So there was no way for me to make the channeling mudra with my hands to do it.

R-Right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess she really didn't channel Inga then.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya, when mediums are done with a session... ...they can send the spirit back to the other world themselves, right?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sure, unless they're still in training. Amateurs can get possessed by spirits sometimes... ...but full-fledged mediums can stay in total control of a session. And they can send the deceased's spirit away anytime they want.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So I take you can do that, too, Ms. Fey?

Of course! It's a cinch for the new-and-improved Mystic Maya Fey, Ace Spirit Medium!

Hm? I don't get where you're going with this...

Channeling Minister Inga alone wouldn't be enough to fool someone like Princess Rayfa. Especially if he were wearing your clothes. So you would've had to change into the minister's clothes before channeling him.

Do you know my husband's name?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
It was, umm... "Inga Karkhuul Khura'in"... right?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
That is correct, in part. But there's more... Much more. Inga Karkhuul Haw'kohd Dis'nahm Bi'ahni Lawga Ormo Pohmpus Da'nit Ar'edi Iz Khura'in III. That is his true name.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Could it be any longer...?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Due to its length, only a portion of it was ever made public. So, Ms. Fey. Did you know his true name?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
N-No. I mean, how could I...?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Precisely. Yet a medium must know both the face AND true name of the one she seeks to channel.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaagh! S-So then... Ms. Fey couldn't have channeled Minister Inga?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
That's what I've been saying this whole time! Why would I want to randomly channel some old guy I didn't know... ...and didn't like, thanks to that last trial.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I-I can't believe this...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apollo... I really don't think Maya's lying. However, your line of reasoning still seems credible to me.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I agree, but there's something tripping us up in the details. Maybe we're working off of some <span style="color:#E16935">wrong assumption</span> again.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
.........Um, Apollo? I was thinking...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Since I didn't channel Minister Inga... ...is it possible that someone else did?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Someone else? But who else could it have been?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I... haven't thought that far yet.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Such chatter is without merit. Let us move on, shall we?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Urk. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't care what Ga'ran says. I'm going to figure this out. If it wasn't Ms. Fey, and the queen has an alibi, then...)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apollo, forget about who is capable of channeling spirits for a second.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I should consider the circumstances around the channeling, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Right. We know Rayfa saw her father come running out of his private quarters. If he was being channeled at the time, who could it have been?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It had to have been... <span style="color:#E16935">someone who was in Inga's private quarters</span>.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Well, I'm waiting, defense. And you know how much I despise waiting.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, but! There is someone else besides Ms. Fey who could've channeled Minister Inga! <span style="color:#0070C0">(There is just one more person... And <span style="color:#E16935">they were in Inga's private quarters</span>. That person is our only hope now!)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
So the defense believes there was another. Let's have your very serious answer then.

Nayna...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Your Eminence said it yourself...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ga'ran:<br />
That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
How do you know?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
And then there's Her Benevolence's statement. She said that Nayna disappeared right after she entered Minister Inga's private quarters... ...the room from which Minister Inga himself came running out of not long afterwards.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
You are not seriously suggesting...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It's the only thing that makes sense. Nayna channeled Minister Inga and left his private quarters thereafter. That's why no one has seen her since... ...and why only the minister's shoeprints were found outside his residence!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...Ah! No waaaaaaaaay!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

What? Nayna's here? I thought she'd gone missing.

It seems she was feeling unwell, and simply wished to rest undisturbed. But her concern for Rayfa brought her here today.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She took time off without Rayfa's knowledge or consent?)</span>

<p>Judge:<br />
Ms. Nayna, do you understand why you have been summoned here today?
</p><p>Nayna:<br />
........................ Yes, of course. Her Eminence has informed me that this man here suspects I have committed a crime.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So this is Nayna... That's quite the hairdo.)</span>
</p><p>Nayna:<br />

You there, young Horn Head.

...I think not. For that goes against the very underpinnings of the Kingdom of Khura'in.

To become a spirit medium requires a noble spirit and rigorous training. But most importantly, one must be <span style="color:#E16935">a direct descendant of the founder</span>. It is not simply some hobby one can take up in the manner of knitting or gardening.

I am from a line of humble fishermen, all the way back to my grandfather's grandfather. I've never heard talk of royal blood or noble ancestry.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apollo. If spirit channeling is a <span style="color:#E16935">secret art</span> passed down from mother to daughter... ...then even with a royal ancestor, it'd be impossible to learn without the right training.

It is as the Barbed One says. It also must be mentioned that this secret art... ...is only taught here in the Kingdom of Khura'in, and your country's Kurain Village.

Hold on -- I'm getting to it, Your Magistry. ............ <span style="color:#0070C0">(Nayna stated an absolute falsehood... ...since we know that Amara is still alive.

Qu-Queen Amara! What... What does this all mean?! Were you not killed in that fire twenty-three years ago?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
I barely escaped that blaze with my life. But though I survived, I knew that scoundrel would make further attempts on my life. Therefore, I staged my death and abdicated the throne to my dear younger sister, Ga'ran.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But the building of that great tomb...! A-And disguising yourself as a lowly servant! Why would you do such a thing?!
</p><p>Amara:<br />
...Ga'ran. I would have you explain.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I wished for her to be close at hand. It was the only way I felt I could protect her. And it was the best way to hide her from the eyes of the public. After all, who could conceive of Amara lowering her station to that of a servant?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
She's got that right. Even Dhurke thought Amara was being held captive in some far-off place.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
He never even guessed she was living as a servant, right in plain sight.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
I must say, a life dedicated to the servitude of others is not the least bit disagreeable. It is a quiet, humble existence -- far removed from the tedium of regal duties. Ah... But those days of peace have ended. And it's all because of you... Horn Head.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You should consider yourself lucky if that's all this ends with.

If there is something you wish to say, then say it.

It doesn't matter who you are, you won't escape the crime you committed. The defense... moves to indict you as Justice Minister Inga's real killer!

What's this?! You would accuse Queen Amara of homicide?! A grand priestess of Khura'inism?! Y-You can't do that! Sh-She's... virtually a goddess in the eyes of her people!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
If you commit the crime, you'd better be ready to do the time. Be you a priest, saint, queen, or god.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I've... never met such an egalitarian person...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Queen Amara. In your years disguised as Nayna, you would have learned about Minister Inga's disorder. So you knew you could dress in Dhurke's clothes to forge a convincing Séance vision. Isn't that right?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
...O ho ho ho ho. What a curious character you are. You would label me a murderer? Me -- the one who the people regarded as the reincarnation of the Holy Mother herself?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You may be a grand figure in Khura'inism... ...but as a foreigner, you're just another suspect to me.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
......... .........It would appear your words are not in jest. Am I to suffer the sullying of my good name with accusations of murder most foul? ...............

P-Please, Queen Amara! Forgive his impudence! The lawyer knows not what he speaks!

...Oh, young lawyer. In my benevolence, I must warn you that your assertion suffers from a tragic flaw.

Nahyuta.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Y-Yes, Your Mercifulness?

Who was present in the tomb when the murder was discovered?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Dhurke Sahdmadhi, Maya Fey, and the victim, Minister Inga.&#160;! .........I see. That is a fatal flaw indeed. It appears Queen Amara couldn't possibly have gone to the tomb as Minister Inga.

Yes, Your Mercifulness. Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa saw Minister Inga enter the tomb around 2:30 PM. Yet you, the defense, claim the person she saw... ...was the minister being channeled by Queen Amara. However, if Her Mercifulness had channeled him... ...and moved to the tomb... ...then, once she was done channeling... ...Queen Amara would have re-emerged and been left stuck in the tomb.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, yeah...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Had she tried to exit before you all arrived... ...Princess Rayfa, who had been looking down upon the courtyard, would have seen her. However, Her Benevolence saw nothing of the sort.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Urk.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
In conclusion, Queen Amara could not have left the tomb without being observed. And yet, was she there in the tomb when the murder was discovered, defense?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........N-No. No, she wasn't.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Hmph.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Now do you see? Your flimsy claim has been uprooted like a sapling in a flood.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nngh......... Aaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Well. That was entertaining. Prosecutor Sadhmadhi. Assume the prosecution of this case and clear your mother's good name.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You wish for me to take over?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Yes. Prosecute your father to save your mother. Heh heh heh. What a poignant fate you bear, but bear it you must. Are you ready?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Yes, Your Eminence!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...And there you have it, Your Magistry. I shall watch the rest of the proceedings from the sidelines. I relinquish complete control of this sacred hall to your authority once more.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-Why, thank you, Your Eminence. Now then, Your Mercifulness. Your testimony, if you please.

Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory.<br />
I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder.<br />
Were your theory correct, I would have been in the tomb once I had stopped channeling.<br />
My husband Dhurke is the killer, but he has fled from this sacred hall.<br />
May the Holy Mother rain judgment upon the traitor Dhurke Sahdmadhi for his crimes.

<p>Judge:<br />
Oh, such marvelous testimony. You are truly a treasure, Your Mercifulness.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
This, too, is but by the grace of Her Holiness. No doubt my unmasking here today was Her will as well.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, my... The Holy Mother, you say?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Yes. Surely Her Holiness has guided me to this witness stand... ...and to the purity of truth!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
No, no, no, it's definitely not like that, Your Mercifulness... First of all, you don't really believe he's trying to kill you, do you? After all, you two ran off together after he rescued you all those years ago.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
That was only because he had the audacity to claim, "It wasn't me! You must believe me!" It was my duty as a wife to her husband... ...to bend an ear to him, was it not? Communication after disagreement... is the secret to a long and happy marriage.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p><p>Amara:<br />
............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...You have something to counter with?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require <span style="color:#E16935">a deceased person</span> to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Gnrk! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's true, but... ...I can't rule it out yet. Because... Well...)</span> .........What if there WAS another victim? Someone we haven't identified yet.

...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. <span style="color:#0070C0">(This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?)</span>

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I demand an explanation, Mr. Justice!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........I don't know when or why Dhurke was murdered. But the facts and evidence speak for themselves. .........And this... This is where they've led me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...I see. After Inga's murder, Dhurke and Maya were the only ones in the tomb. But if one of them was actually dead and being channeled by Amara... But it can't be... can it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Dhurke's bloodstain at the scene of the crime was the clincher for me. He wasn't even injured, so how could he have possibly bled that much? The only logical explanation is... ...Dhurke had also been murdered!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Th-That's enough. Your explanation cannot be the truth! A-And you would not dare to claim to have proof to support your assertion.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...............Nahyuta. I wish it weren't true... I wish with all my heart that I'm wrong! But as much as I don't want to believe it... y-yes... I can prove it... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke's killer must've hidden his body. It would have to be somewhere nobody would ever look. And there is only one such place...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Y-You truly... have proof?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The fastest way... would be to actually have someone go check the tomb.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Go check the tomb...? But why?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:green">Because I believe Dhurke's killer hid his body here.</span>

Queen Amara's sarcophagus... The only place in the tomb that no one would dare to look. Plus, a killer would soon become trapped by hiding in there. But a body... well, that's a horse of a different color. Wh-Which means... .........Urngh!

I'm positive. No autopsy's been performed yet, but I'd say it's been at least three days. Fortunately, the low temperature inside the sarcophagus kept it from decaying... Oh, and the chest area bore three gunshot wounds from a small caliber weapon. I believe they are the cause of death.

Mm-hm. A pretty big one...

<p>Apollo:<br />
Dhurke didn't want his own death to be known. The other members of the Defiant Dragons would lose all hope if they found out. And that would snuff out the flames of revolution for good. Ms. Fey. Dhurke told you to keep quiet about this, didn't he?

It was soon after I was kidnapped. Dhurke paid me a visit in that tomb where I was being held captive. I'd say it was a few days before Minister Inga's murder.

Hey, young lady. Time to get you up and out of here.

Dhurke... was talking about you, Apollo. He said he wanted to see you... one last time. So he asked me to return to the U.S. and channel his spirit.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...He really said that?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Mm-hm. He also said he'd been meaning to visit you for years, but kept putting it off. And that this was his last chance.

<p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke... You really did come to the U.S. because you wanted to see me.)</span>

</p><p>Maya:<br />
.........Apollo. You can't stop now. Dhurke would want you to keep pressing on.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.....................I know, Ms. Fey. And I won't disappoint him.

..................Defense, if you are ready to proceed... ...I would first have you answer this: Do you believe the accused's death will impact what we know about this case?

.........Yes, and I believe I can explain everything now.

Very well. Your explanation, please.

Dhurke entered the tomb at 3 PM, the time the hostage exchange was to take place. Or rather, Dhurke -- as channeled by Ms. Fey -- did. Now, by the time he entered the tomb at <span style="color:#E16935">3 PM</span>... ...Minister Inga was already dead.

The fact of the matter is, Queen Amara killed Minister Inga at 2 PM. She then went to his private quarters and channeled his spirit. The minister, thinking he was going to be late, hurried to the tomb for the hostage exchange. But once in the tomb... Queen Amara stopped channeling Minister Inga and hid herself. Then, when Dhurke entered at 3 PM... ...she snuck up from behind... ...and forcibly drove Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. And you've seen one in action before. You saw how the glowing red magatama sent the high priest back to the Twilight Realm... ...and how it turned a spent, pale brown afterwards.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
In other words, the brown magatama found in the tomb looks that way because... ...its power had been used up in pushing Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body, right?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I probably passed out as soon as Dhurke's spirit left my body. I was exhausted after channeling him for so long, after all.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
After that, Queen Amara must've dressed Ms. Fey in her usual outfit, and tied her up. I'm not sure where she got the outfit, but we can assume she had it all planned out. Then, Queen Amara must've changed into Dhurke's clothes, smeared blood onto them... ...picked up the knife, and channeled Dhurke's spirit. That's how she made it look like Dhurke had committed the crime! And that's how she escaped -- right under our noses!
</p><p>Amara:<br />
.........Gah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
......I don't know, Apollo. The whole thing still seems a bit... far-fetched.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(.........Dhurke. What was going through your mind while all this was unfolding?)</span>
</p>
<center>.....................</center>
<p><br />
</p>
<center>...Hmph. So ultimately, it was all for naught.</center>
<p><br />
Apollo:<br />
Nahyuta?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Those dreams of revolution Dhurke was always spouting... They placed nothing but false hope in the minds of the people. And in the end, they were simply fantasies.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nahyuta... How can you--!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

Karma has spoken. The dream of revolution has withered on the vine. Its fate is sealed. The other insurgents will soon wake from their shattered dreams.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No. Dhurke's dream can't die like this. I'm not going to sit back and let that happen. I can't, and I won't!)</span> Nahyuta... Don't forget that Dhurke's been proven innocent. His name is no longer tainted by the charge of murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Now the rebels and their sympathizers who have been calling for his release... ...can't be charged with abetting the accused. So the revolution is far from over -- it's only just begun!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
No, Dhurke has not yet been proven innocent. You have merely indicated the possibility of his innocence.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-What do you mean?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Dhurke is indeed dead. However... What if it was Dhurke who killed Minister Inga while being channeled by Ms. Fey? And while the crime could have occurred at 2 PM, you have yet to substantively prove it. ...Or do you have conclusive proof that the time of Minister Inga's death was at 2 PM?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
W-Well, no, I don't, but...
</p><p>Amara:<br />
.........It seems further testimony will be required of me. As it would appear that I have fallen under suspicion, I would like to state my case.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, the rebellion must be snuffed out once and for all. You MUST prove Dhurke Sahdmadhi to be the foul murderer that he was. And every last insurgent and their sympathizers... ...must be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why is Nahyuta doing this? Ga'ran shouldn't have him under her thumb anymore. Amara's not a hostage, so what gives? Nahyuta... What's left to chain you to her like this?)</span>

You lack the evidence to support your claim that Queen Amara is the killer. Which is why you have had to use the process of elimination to zero in on her.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You're saying the Dhurke who entered the tomb is the one who killed Minister Inga?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
I am. I stand firm with the prosecution's original charge against the accused. The only issue is whether that Dhurke was alive or dead.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's a pretty major issue.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Oh, I beg to differ. For here in Khura'in, death is not the end. It is merely a change in one's address, for the Twilight Realm is only the next door over.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Is it really?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
It is. Those who have only recently passed away may call upon you in the night. Such occurrences are quite common in our kingdom.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's kidding... right?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
In all the time I've spent here, I'm happy to say that's never happened to me.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Me, neither.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
You need not fear death. Embrace it, along with your guilt. Then may you begin your journey to the Twilight Realm.

Once the king of traitors has been judged, and the rebellion quelled for good... ...peace and prosperity shall return to our fair kingdom. Then shall the blessings of the Holy Mother usher in an age of eternal glory.

Hmm... With Queen Amara as the Grand Priestess of Khura'in once more... ...the people would be freed from subversive elements. Faith would blossom anew!

Oh, you are too kind. But I have no intention of resuming my position as grand priestess.

What...?!
</p><p>Amara:<br />
I relinquished my position as queen and grand priestess to my sister Ga'ran. And now that my would-be assassin is gone, I am truly free at last. O ho ho. Perhaps I shall take a trip, or expand my horizons with new training.

Th-This... cannot be! Mother! Tell me it does not belong to you.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
...............N-Nahyuta... I..................
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Think about it, Queen Amara. Dhurke must've realized that you were channeling his spirit. And he had probably already figured out who the minister's killer was. And yet... ...he still claimed that the pink pendant belonged to him.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
...! But why would he do such a thing?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You really don't know? He was protecting you. ...Because he loved you. He loved you until his very last breath, and beyond.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dhurke:<br />
I have one more... big <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span>. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying <span style="color:#E16935">a certain someone</span> if I did.

</p><p>Amara:<br />
..................Dhurke. Why do you always...?

Well, Queen Amara? Dhurke -- the one whose love for you never wavered all these years... Are you going to betray him now?!

Th-This cannot be... I refuse to accept it!

Queen Amara, are you ready to confess to your crime?

..................I can deny it no longer. The truth is... it was I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, who slew Minister Inga.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Th-That's preposterous! Wh-Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!

Th-This is beyond belief!

Forgive me, Nahyuta. I never wished to cause you such sorrow. But... I had no choice. It was the only way.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The only way?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
............... .........So, in the end, Queen Amara and Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I suppose this means that they were unable to reconcile while he was still alive.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I don't think the state of the kingdom or the incidents of the past would've allowed that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
They were prisoners of their shared history, so to speak.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Queen Amara, there's something I need to know. You had staged a near-perfect crime. So why did you bring this pendant into the tomb with you? You should've known it could come back to haunt you.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
.........I do not really understand it myself. I had nearly been assassinated by my own husband... ...yet I could not bear any hatred toward him. I was unable to discard this, or part with it for even a short time. As with Dhurke... ...I have never stopped loving my husband for the past twenty-three years.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........Mother.

Your Magistry, is it not time? Time to declare Dhurke innocent? I would ask that you do this for my beloved, who now dwells in the Twilight Realm.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Very well, then. Your Eminence, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you have no further objections...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Arrngh! This cannot be. My mother...?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke, I did it -- I finally did it! I proved your innocence! But............)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, then. Being that Queen Amara yet lives... ...we can no longer charge the accused with an assassination that never came to fruition. As for the murder of Minister Inga, the truth has been laid bare for all to see. Therefore, I will now pass judgement upon the accused, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi.

<p>Apollo:<br />
Um, Queen Amara? ...There's something I still don't understand. What was your <span style="color:#E16935">motive</span> for killing Justice Minister Inga?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
.........That is a fair question, and one that I shall now answer. It was for the future of this kingdom that I slew Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. To avert further tragedy, his death was an unfortunate necessity.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Further tragedy?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Over the past several years, Minister Inga had been rapidly expanding his power. He had established the secret police, and was relentless in his pursuit of the insurgents. He even had the overwhelming support of the people, but still he was not satisfied. Hungry for more power, he began planning a coup d'état.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You mean his plot involving the Founder's Orb, which led to Maya Fey's abduction?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Yes. Minister Inga planned to use the orb to gain access to great spiritual power... ...after which, he would assassinate Ga'ran and usurp the throne.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
His machinations were reminiscent of that terrible tragedy of twenty-three years ago. And as one affected by that incident... ...Amara vowed to never allow a repeat of such events.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
Yes, and the Holy Mother delivered unto me the perfect opportunity to fulfill my vow. Security amid the courtyard was rather light due to the Rite of Channeling. And Inga had barricaded himself in the tomb with his hostage, away from prying eyes. I knew I would never again have such a perfect opportunity, so... ...at 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yep. It seems this trial is far from over. Queen Amara, I believe you're still hiding something!

The two of you look quite similar. But that's no surprise, considering you're sisters. Even the shape and position of your facial tattoos are almost exactly the same. And you are both capable of channeling spirits. Therefore, it would've been easy for you to impersonate Queen Ga'ran.

Exactly. She now has an ironclad alibi. So Minister Inga's killer couldn't have been Queen Amara.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I am afraid... I no longer follow, defense. Was it not Queen Amara who channeled the minister and the accused to stage the crime?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, that fact has not changed. We have evidence placing her at the scene of the crime. And Dhurke could've only been there in the tomb if she were channeling him. Which means... While Queen Amara did use spirit channeling to stage the crime... ...she didn't kill Minister Inga. <span style="color:#E16935">His real killer is someone else</span>!

..................Dhurke. That was a real shocker, all right. Can't believe the dragon is dead.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Datz...
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Say, AJ... I was wondering... When Dhurke disappeared after I freed him... ...that's because Amara turned back into herself, right?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah, I suppose so. But I don't know if it was because Dhurke's spirit willed it... ...or if it was a part of Ga'ran or Amara's plan.
</p><p>Datz:<br />
........................Man... Our dream of revolution... Now what're we gonna do? Is this it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Don't give up yet. There is a very good chance that Ga'ran is the real culprit in all this. And if we can prove her guilt in court...
</p><p>Datz:<br />
...Hey, you're right! That could be just the push we need. The dream lives on!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Yes, it does.
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Ya know what that means, AJ? The fate o' the revolution rests squarely on your shoulders!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Heh, heh. All in a day's work... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh, who am I kidding? That's a ton of pressure. But this is what Dhurke gave his life for, so I have to do this for him.)</span>

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Where's Nahyuta?)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I must offer my apologies. I never imagined a royal guardsman would do such a thing.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What? He wasn't acting under your orders?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
H-How dare you cast such suspicions upon Her Eminence!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
It is quite all right, Your Magistry. Suspicion is only natural under such circumstances. But rest assured that he acted alone, for I knew nothing of his plans.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't believe that for a second.)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Now then, Your Magistry. Regarding the murder of my husband, Minister Inga... ...I would like to offer a new possibility.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A new possibility, you say?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Indeed. For during the break, the <span style="color:#E16935">real killer</span> confessed to me.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Bailiff, call the witness to the stand.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The real killer confessed...? What's she got up her sleeve this time?

</p><p>Judge:<br />
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! YOU'RE the real killer?!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I questioned him during the recess, as I felt that Amara had been covering for someone. So it was that he finally confessed his crime to me.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
N-Nahyuta... You didn't really do it, did you?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.................. ........................ Her Eminence speaks the truth. ...It was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
N... Nahyutaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Peace! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you absolutely certain about this? A confession of this nature is grave indeed!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes, I am certain. For I killed him by my own hand.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Heh heh heh. At last, the real killer has been revealed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
H-How are we supposed to respond to this?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nahyuta! Retract your confession! Now!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........Mr. Justice. It is not yet time for your cross-examination.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You kept quiet all this time, even though you were the real killer?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Yes. And I accept that what I have done can never be forgiven. But I never imagined suspicion would fall upon the queen herself.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has placed the future of our kingdom above his own life. He is taking responsibility for his crime and is showing his loyalty to queen and country.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Minister Inga was planning to assassinate Her Eminence in a coup d'état. I had to nip this evil in the bud, even if it cost me the purity of my soul.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...So you're saying the death of another is a reasonable price to pay to protect the queen?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Long have we remained independent under the authority of our spirit medium queens. We command the people's awe and respect with the power to commune with the dead. Without such a monarch, our kingdom would lose its standing in the world.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
But if spirit channeling is so important, why did you have Queen Amara perform the rite?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I'm afraid my elder sister is quite capricious. She would fulfill her duty only when the desire to struck, <i>[sic]</i> as sporadic as that was. It was, therefore, something she did on a whim. There was no meaning behind it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A meaningless whim?

It's hard to press a statement like that.

Yes. I rendered judgement upon the minister on behalf of the Holy Mother.

Are you saying the Holy Mother guided you?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
No. Her Holiness would never condone killing in her name, regardless of circumstances. As such, I believe my defiled soul will be damned to hell. But I do not regret what I have done. I willingly sacrificed my soul to protect this kingdom's future.

So Nahyuta got to meet his mother... ...back when Dhurke rescued her.

That's what he's saying. It's news to me, though -- I had already been sent away by that point. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Okay, now that I've dragged more testimony out of him... ...what can I do with it?)</span>

You're saying that Dhurke made off with Queen Amara <span style="color:#E16935">fifteen years ago</span>. But that's strange... Because I heard something very different from Dhurke. He said that they ran off together <span style="color:#E16935">twenty-three years ago</span>.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...That is impossible. I know for a fact it was fifteen years ago.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Well, I have evidence that contradicts your statement. How do you explain this photo? Dhurke said it was taken twenty-three years ago.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
He said that...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
He did, but if we take what he said as fact... ...then there's something in this photo that doesn't make any sense.

Nahyuta, this discrepancy may not be directly related to this case... ...but I don't think we can simply overlook it either. Dhurke said the baby in the photo was you. But that doesn't make any sense if the photo's only fifteen years old. After all, you said you were around ten then, right?

Y-You presume too much...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ahh... And that's why Queen Amara was trying to take the rap as well. To protect this other child.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A child born fifteen years ago... Hmm... They would have to be someone who's around fourteen or fifteen years old now.

From Mother... and only yesterday.

Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the "truth" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.

Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right?

...Apollo. It all goes back to that incident twenty-three years ago. It's branded him the son of a criminal.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So if we could once and for all prove that Dhurke didn't try to assassinate Amara...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Right. Nahyuta and Rayfa's father would no longer be viewed as a criminal.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
But I thought there wasn't any evidence left... ...because it was all destroyed in the fire. And Dhurke investigated the matter for years, but never managed to learn anything new.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
.........Really? Nothing at all? Could an exceptional lawyer like Dhurke try that long and really uncover nothing at all? He had over two decades, Apollo.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right. I doubt Dhurke would've gone to his grave without discovering something new. He must've secretly planted something to topple Ga'ran with somewhere.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Take another look at the evidence. You just might find what we need to break out of this situation with in there.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
G-Got it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........If the defense is done stalling for time, I shall now render my verdict.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
N-No, wait! About the assassination attempt twenty-three years ago... ...the defense has some new information it would like to share!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You do?! Hmm... While we HAD intended to deliberate that case in the course of this trial... Hmm...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke... Did you leave something behind for me? Is there some connection I'm missing here?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, then. <span style="color:green">What is the source of your "new information" about the case form twenty-three years ago?</span>

<p>Judge:<br />
A photograph?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes. Do you recall the traveling musician who died in that fire twenty-three years ago?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How could anyone forget such a painful chapter in our history? The poor fellow was caught up in the blaze that was meant for Queen Amara. We never knew his identity, though, as his belongings were burnt to ashes.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Well, about that... The truth is, he was my biological father.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Wh-What?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Why, of course! With his photo and Her Benevolence...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Exactly -- we might be able to prove Dhurke completely innocent. And that would free her from the infamy of having criminal blood in her veins. Because here in Khura'in... ...we can witness the final memories of the dead!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Wh-What utter nonsense! Th-There... was no evidence left in the wake of that blaze!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's what you think. But Dhurke went to the ends of the Earth to bring this little souvenir back for us.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
H-He did?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yep, and boy is it the best piece of evidence ever. He knew that with it, we'd finally be able to conclusively settle the matter here in court... ...and save his children. Your Magistry, the defense requests that we hold a Divination Séance for this new victim!

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Augh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As the presiding judge, I will now share my thoughts on the matter. The attempted assassination of Queen Amara is a case we can ill afford to leave open. And I believe that the final memories of the victim will prove to be very important. Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that we should conduct another Divination Séance.

O Holy Mother! We hold this <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séance</span> in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion!

</p>

<p>Judge:<br />
The spirit of the victim has granted us a window into his final moments. It would appear the Divination Séance was a success.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter that was found at the crime scene. However... ...the hand holding the lighter in the Séance vision appears to be gloved.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...Ah! I-I believe you are right. What could this mean?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It calls into question whether the hand in the vision really was Dhurke's. If only we could make out the details a little better...
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Very well. I will attempt to focus a bit more on what the deceased saw. Perhaps that will help refine the Séance vision. Hmm... It does seem that there was a glove on that hand. Still... what significance could that have?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It means that Dhurke's fingerprints got on the lighter at some other time. Somebody could have even put them there after the fire.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Your Eminence... I can turn the other cheek no more. Therefore... I hereby retract my confession in the murder of Justice Minister Inga!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Retract, you say...?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke... The final piece of evidence you left behind... ...has released Nahyuta from his suffering. And now, he's finally free...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
In all this time, not once did I reflect on my own conduct -- for I had believed all was fate. Lost in my own sense of resignation, I was unable to wake from my despair. But you, Apollo. You have awakened me with your demonstration of our father's creed. A dragon never yields. I will carry on Dhurke's legacy, and fulfill his dream. Hear me, Ga'ran: I will cast you down from your bloody throne! Long live the revolution!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Rrrrrgh! Insolent fool! Now even YOU prattle on about revolution?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Would you look at that. Well, Apollo... It seems we're finally making some headway down the road that Dhurke carved out for us.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Yeah. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Now, if we could just prove Ga'ran's guilt... ...we could continue on down that road -- towards the revolution Dhurke dreamed of.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Your Eminence. You have been accused of the crime committed twewnty-three years ago. Would you like to say anything in your defense?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Not so fast, Your Magistry. For the cuffs could have been stolen and used without my knowledge. So, you see, they can hardly be considered proof of anything!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-Why, I believe you're right.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! But we KNOW she's guilty!)</span>
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Heh heh heh. Well, lawyer? Is there any other evidence you would have me refute?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Unfortunately, this photo was the last piece of evidence Dhurke left for me. So as far as evidence goes, I've got nothing else regarding that case from the past. However, now that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has retracted his confession... ...we'll have to redeliberate the current case from scratch.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Yes. The defense speaks the truth... ...even though it is clear who the guilty party is.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Queen Ga'ran! The defense accuses you of the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Gnrk!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But... do you have any evidence, defense?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Evidence that will prove Ga'ran was the killer...?)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
There is still one more avenue for us to explore, Mr. Justice.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
There is?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Minister Inga's final memories. In them, the minister's killer posed as Dhurke. Therefore, one must ask, how did the killer dispose of their disguise?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........Hey, you're right! A lot of blood would've spattered onto the killer. So the blood-soaked clothes would have to have been dealt with somehow. If they're still around somewhere, then...!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........Then you don't know us very well. Your Benevolence.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
On the day of your father's murder, you had been watching the courtyard from 2 PM. Now, during that time, you saw Queen Ga'ran, did you not?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
............Y-Yes, I did. I saw my mother entering the palace from the courtyard. But I was told not to mention it because it had nothing to do with my father's murder.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
! R-Rayfa! Y-You would not dare...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
When the queen headed into the palace, did she have Dhurke's clothes in her possession?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
.........No. No, she did not!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So... maybe she disposed of them somewhere in the courtyard.

</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
The police did a thorough sweep of the area following the crime. But they did not find anything resembling Dhurke's clothes. But you knew that already, didn't you, prosecutor?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........Y-Yes. I admit no clothing was found.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Heh, so you admit that you were merely speculating... ...chasing phantoms and delusions of evidence that never existed.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This makes no sense. Clothing doesn't just disappear like that.)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If Ga'ran wasn't carrying any clothes, she must've gotten rid of them somewhere. Somewhere where she thought they'd never be found.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Where they'd never be found, huh...)</span> <span style="color:green">I believe Dhurke's clothes were hidden here.</span>

...Yes, of course. At the time of the minister's murder, Dhurke's body was already in the sarcophagus. So the killer could have simply borrowed his clothes.

Right. Before the minister entered the tomb, the killer put on Dhurke's clothes... ...and then hid behind the curtain above the sarcophagus. And after the minister was killed, Dhurke's clothes were returned to his body.

I'm afraid such arguments are invalid here in this sacred hall, Your Eminence. Because even monarchs aren't above the law.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
...Nnngh.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It's the end of the line for you, Queen Ga'ran. Time to come down from that lofty throne and face justice!

Ga'ran:<br />
.........Me? Face justice? Surely you jest. You are in no position to force my hand, lawyer.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Surely you haven't forgotten about the <span style="color:#E16935">Defense Culpability Act</span>? "...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty." In short, should I be convicted of murdering my husband... ...your dear brother, who delivered false testimony in my defense... ...shall also be found guilty!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-What?! Th-That can't be...! Can it...?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...By delivering false testimony in the course of protecting a guilty party... ...he would certainly be judged by this court as having <span style="color:#E16935">supported a criminal</span>... ...and the Defense Culpability Act would most definitely come into play.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
B-But that law is so broad that ANYONE could be convicted under it...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
When it comes to the DC Act, even I am conflicted, and yet, as it currently stands... ...it is the law of the land. And as you said earlier, no one is above the law.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Of all the absurd things I've seen, this law really takes the cake.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
N-Now what...? What can we even DO at this point...?!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Heh heh heh... You need not look so forlorn. Dhurke has been cleared of all charges. So let us leave all thoughts of the real killer and revolution in the past where it belongs.

! All right, but how? It's not like we have a lot of time to come up with a way to do it, either. I doubt she'll allow you to perform another cross-examination while we think.

Don't worry. I'll come up with something. We'll be fine! <span style="color:#0070C0">(We can't give up -- not now. We have to keep on fighting to the end! We can't allow these broken trials to go on. It's time to make things right!)</span>

Dhurke was convinced that the orb is the key to the revolution, and Khura'in's future. In light of Ga'ran's obsession with the orb, it makes a large amount of sense. She probably doesn't want anyone using it to gain spiritual powers, and rights to the throne.

In Khura'in, the ability to channel spirits is an absolute requirement for a would-be queen. But, Your Eminence, if you were incapable of doing that... ...then you'd have no claim to the throne. Not only that, but every law you've passed would be rendered null and void.

All the conditions for summoning the founder should be in place. With the orb, we know what the founder looks like. And as queen, you should know the founder's name.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Gnrk.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Now, if you would, Your Eminence! Please show us the great spiritual power you bear as Grand Priestess of Khura'in!
</p><p>Royal Guard:<br />
OHHH! To witness Her Eminence's great power with our own eyes?! Th-The Holy Mother will appear before us?! Oh, great miracle of miracles! Praise be, Your Eminence! May your mighty spiritual power show us the way!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Urrg-g-g-g-gh.
</p><p>Royal Guard:<br />
Ur dihara Ga'ran!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
E-Enough! Enough I say, you mindless cretins!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Your Eminence? Can it be... that you cannot...?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
N-No, no! I... I...! I want a lawyer! Summon one at once!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Aren't you forgetting something? There aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in. You can thank your Defense Culpability Act for that.
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Augh...!
</p><p>Royal Guard:<br />
Your Emineeeeence! Please, give us a glimpse of your maaaaaaagnificent spiritual power! Summon Her Holiness so she may guuuuuide us!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
I have heard enough from you! OUT OF MY SIGHT! ALL OF YOU!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
If you truly are capable of channeling spirits, then get on with it already, Your Eminence!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Nnngaaaargh... You sneaky, underhanded--! WRETCH of a lawyer!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That reminds me. You said something to this effect earlier: "It is time to cease this insanity." Don't you feel stupid for saying that now?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Indeed. Of all the things she has said, I can think of nothing more ludicrous. ...Apollo. Teach this deceitful, putrid queen a lesson she won't soon forget.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Gladly. Because it really is time to cease this insanity.
</p>

<p>Apollo:<br />
Ga'ran! Your reign of terror... ends here!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ga'ran:<br />
Hrrrnnnnn.............. ............... Very well. Demonstrating my facility as a spirit medium is simple enough. Behold! The magnificent power to commune with the dead...!
</p>

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! Your Emineeeeeence!!!
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
O great spirit of the founder who dwells in the Twilight Realm. Heed the secret covenant of the orb... and appear here before us!

...Ooh. H-Here it comes...

What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
</p><p>Ga'ran:<br />
Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnngh! HAAaaaaAAAAAaaaAAAH... O spirit of the founder! Grace us with your sacred presence! The time is now! I beseech you! Appear before us! ...H-Heed my call! Founder, please! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrn... NNNRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! .................................... *gasp!*

<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, how is Her Eminence?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It seems... she now believes that she herself is the Holy Mother.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I see... But her attempt at spirit channeling failed, did it not?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Sadly, she seems unable to accept the facts. *sigh* I fear it will be quite a challenge to question her later.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........And what, if I may ask, was her motive? I understand that she killed Minister Inga in order to prevent his coup d'état... ...but what of her attempt to assassinate Queen Amara twenty-three years ago?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
To become queen herself? Maybe she just craved power and attention.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...She likely developed a psychological complex from her inability to channel spirits. That is why she kept Queen Amara alive to perform the Rite of Channeling for her. In that way, it would seem as if she had great spiritual power. In short, she built a cult of personality upon fear and lies. Then again, do not all tyrants?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...So then, she never really intended to kill Amara, huh.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What I don't understand is why Queen Amara even listened to Ga'ran in the first place. Especially fourteen years ago, before Rayfa was being held hostage. Why would she keep letting the people of Khura'in think she was dead... ...while she kept quietly performing the Rite of Channeling for Ga'ran?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...My mother is a gentle soul by nature, and loves her sister dearly. So when Ga'ran told her to hide because Dhurke was out to kill her, she believed it. What's more, she did not wish to tarnish the name of her beloved sister... That is why she acquiesced so obediently to Ga'ran's request to keep channeling for her. Until she fled with Dhurke and was told the truth, that is.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...So that's what happened.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And since Rayfa was being held captive... ...I imagine Amara had no choice but to help cover up the truth behind Inga's murder.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah, living secretly as Rayfa's servant Nayna... ...no doubt only deepened her love for her daughter. She'd do anything to keep her safe.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
All the more reason to hide the painful truth from her.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, that was a case for the ages. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has been cleared of all suspicion in the murder of Minister Inga... ...as has Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi in the assassination attempt on Queen Amara.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then... ...I think it is high time I handed down my verdict on Dhurke and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi.
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
Apollo:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke, I hope you're watching. I proved your innocence... ...Nahyuta's smiling again... ...and that revolution you've always dreamed of... is finally happening.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
With this, may I finally say... this court is adjourned.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">May 19<br />
High Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby</span></center>
<p><br />
Athena:<br />
Way to go, Apollo!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I was on the edge of my seat when those guards stormed the courtroom.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That was a shocker, all right. Can't imagine anything like that happening back home.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I know, right? I was ready to go on down there and teach them a lesson myself.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
R-Really?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I was barely able to hold her back.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Hold ME back?! YOU were about to go ballistic after a while there, Athena!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yeah, well... I was thinking about helping you smack a few of them down, to be honest.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Remind me to never say or do anything to deserve a Maya-Athena double suplex...)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You did a fine job out there today, Apollo.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Thanks for all the great advice, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Nah, it was all you. That perseverance and never-say-die attitude you showed was impressive. I actually learned a thing or two myself.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-What? From me? That's a laugh.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There were any number of times where I wouldn't have blamed you for giving up. But you stuck it to the end and came away triumphant. By sheer force of will... ...and inner strength forged in countless trials... ...you overcame the most desperate, and hopeless situation I've ever seen.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I-I don't know about all that...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I mean it. You've really come a long way, Apollo. I've nothing but respect for your abilities as an attorney.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Really?! A-Aren't you exaggerating just a little bit, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
You did it, Apollo. You finally won his seal of approval. But what about me, Nick? My channeling's come a long way, too. After all, I was deemed worthy enough to be used in two major crimes already!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah, and two major chances for me to become someone for you to channel next.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Honestly, I couldn't have done this without the support of each and every person here. Mr. Wright, Athena, Nahyuta, and of course... Dhurke.)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
That was pretty cool, Polly!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Tr-Trucy?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Trucy! What are you doing here?!
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
Heh heh heh. It's maaaagic!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm afraid she employed the old, "Let's Stow Away in Mr. Edgeworth's Suitcase" trick.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Whaaaaat?!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Though it certainly explained why my suitcase was so heavy.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Tell me you at least noticed it was heavier than usual...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Umm... Trucy? Do you even have a passport?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
..................... My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space! It's like a mini-universe in there! I could produce a passport at the drop of my hat!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Um, right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Maybe some things in this world are better left a mystery.)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Horn Head! Barbed Head! I am forever in your debt for what you've accomplished in this Hall of Justice. Without your presence, I may have never changed as I have this day. It's pathetic, I know.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
.........That's where you're wrong, Your Benevolence. It was you who changed yourself. Only you could choose to defy Ga'ran. And that decision was yours and yours alone.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right. All we did was present you with an opportunity. And you made use of it with gusto. This victory is yours, Your Benevolence. You should be proud of yourself.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...I... I see. S-So, I am worthy of my title after all. ...Hah. Ha ha ha ha ha! I shall work to heal our kingdom so that it may know peace and prosperity once more!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She sure bounced back quick.)</span> So, Your Benevolence, I take it you learned the truth of your origins? ...That you are the daughter of Dhurke and Queen Amara.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes, my mother... I mean, Her Eminence told me. She said it was a part of my <span style="color:#E16935">disciplining</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...If you can call it that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Sounds more like blackmail. "Keep quiet or I'll tell everyone you're the daughter of a criminal."
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
My mother was so insufferable... or should I say, my former mother.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Sounds like there was no love lost there...)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
But you cleared Dhurke's name. My true father will no longer be known as a criminal. Therefore, I have nothing more to fear.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So, what's next for the Kingdom of Khura'in? I mean, you lost your queen, so...
</p><p>???:<br />
Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa will ascend to the throne.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nahyuta... But she can't channel spirits yet, right?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Indeed. Which is why I will act as regent on her behalf... ...until the day she comes into her own.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes, your help will be greatly appreciated, Prosecutor Sahd... Big B...B...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
........."Buh"?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
B-B-B... Br...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Is she going to say what I think she is...?)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Wh-What are you looking at, you... you... horn-headed nincompoop!
</p><p>*ka-tonk!*
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Youch!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I-In any event, I will be assisted by Nahyuta and Queen Amara for the time being.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Queen Amara?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Our country offers consul to the rulers of neighboring kingdoms through channeling. It is a duty I intend to fulfill myself one day. But for now, I will have Queen Amara assist me in that capacity.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So then... she's going to be all right?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes, it seems the bullet went straight through her without doing any serious damage.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's a relief...
</p><p>Datz:<br />
You did it, AJ! Thanks to you, both Dhurke and Nahyuta beat the charges against 'em! And ya got the revolution rolling to boot!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The revolution... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Dhurke... I guess you were right to believe in me after all.)</span>
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Yessir! There's gonna be some major changes around here. The legal system's gonna return to its rightful state... like how Dhurke always wanted... ...and the name of Apollo Justice will go down in Khura'inese history!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ha ha ha. Yeah, right. Oh, Nahyuta, before I forget... There was something I wanted to give you before I head back home.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...You wish to give me something?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:green">Yes. As Dhurke's birth son, I think you should have this.</span>

Apollo:<br />
Um, so why'd you bring us here, Nahyuta?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Apollo. I want you... to stay here in Khura'in.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?! But why?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
We have lost our queen, and our kingdom stands at a crossroads. Most of all, we will need to rebuild our entire legal system. Naturally... that includes the reintroduction of lawyers to the court.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
W-Wait, you're not asking me to...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes, I want you to take over this law office. With you as a lawyer, and me as a prosecutor... ...we shall rebuild Khura'in's legal system from the ground up.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Y-You want me to help you rebuild the legal system?! That's a lot to take in.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Apollo, I cannot do this without you. As a lawyer, you are Dhurke's spiritual heir. And having studied in America, your legal knowledge will be indispensable.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is way out of my league...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You must be taken aback by my sudden request, but please give it some thought.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
O-Of course. I'm honored that you asked. Still... I have my job back at the Wright Anything Agency to consider, too...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
.........Don't you worry about that, Apollo. Besides, this is something only you can do.

All that we've been taught... The beliefs and convictions that have been passed down to us... We must continue to nurture them so we, in turn, can pass them on to the next generation.

Are you really sure you're okay with him staying, boss?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Uh-huh. I always figured he'd leave the nest someday.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Oh, I think they're almost here!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Just a little... Got it! ...Huh? Wuaaah! Oww...
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Why don't we go and check it out, AJ!
</p>

<p>Trucy:<br />
Go on, Mr. Hat. Introduce yourself.
</p><p>Mr. Hat:<br />
I'm the Amazing Mr. Hat! Nice to meet you. I wanted to take this opportunity to announce my solo debut.
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
It seems Mr. Hat doesn't want Apollo to leave him in the dust.
</p><p>Mr. Hat:<br />
We're fierce rivals, you know. I can't let him hog the spotlight!
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
.........Hmm. It's just not the same without Polly, is it?
</p><p>Mr. Hat:<br />
Yeah, I kind of miss him, too.
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
I know! We should go visit him in Khura'in!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ahlbi:<br />
After seeing Mr. Justice in action, I got to thinking... ...what can I do for Khura'in? Then it came to me: tourism! That's what! I'll develop Khura'in's tourism industry and bring in more visitors! I'll roll out a night tour centered on the Founder's Orb... Ooh! And make a museum dedicated to the Defiant Dragons! Boy, the ideas just keep on coming...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I want to congratulate you on becoming a forensic investigator, Detective Skye.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Thank you! ...But Prosecutor Sahdmadhi says he "has need of me." So starting tomorrow, I'll be working in Khura'in for a while.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Look at it this way: It's sure to be an educational experience.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
True... Plus, I can't let that kid show me up, either... I'll see what I can do for Khura'in's revolution!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Heh. Well, challenges have a way of helping people grow. I look forward to our next investigation upon your return.
</p>

<p>Betty:<br />
Darn that Forehead Face! Ever since he revealed the secret behind our teleportation trick... ...show requests have totally dried up!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
We'll be out on the street if we don't find some work soon. Maybe we should take Trucy up on her offer. She said we could make our debut as magicians at the Wright Anything Agency!
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Shut up! I'm gonna show her up someday. And on my own terms!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Nothing fires you up like a bitter rivalry...
</p>

<p>Beh'leeb:<br />
Khura'in is just like this child right now: full of life and limitless possibilities. I have faith that Dhurke and my darling Tahrust will watch over them both.
</p><p>Datz:<br />
Har har har har har! Have no fear! We'll see Dhurke's legacy through to the end! And just for junior there, here's the secret to being a man among men: Behold, the <span style="color:#E16935">Datz Pose</span>!
</p><p>UWAAAH! UWAAAH!
</p><p>Beh'leeb:<br />
Ooh, it sounds like little Faitah is saying, "No, thanks!"

Haaar har har har har! C'mon, little guy! Don't be shy!

</p><p>Kisegawa:<br />

Thanks, Pearly! Our first order of business will be to <span style="color:#E16935">revolutionize</span> Kurain Village!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Ooh, I have an idea! ...H-How about opening a store where we can buy new outfits like the city girls wear?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Well, look who's all grown up now! But I think there are a few, more pressing matters to take care of first.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Yeah, you're right... I guess it'll be a while before I get my revolutionary makeover.

<p>Rayfa:<br />
Mother, Mother! Now that you have stopped being Nayna... ...I want a new Nayna.

Hmm, I wonder if there would be anyone willing to serve you in that capacity. You are quite a handful, after all.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I am?
</p><p>Amara:<br />
With a simple wave of your hand... ...you would have your attire changed, meals prepared, and even your teeth brushed.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
...T-To think I put such undue burden upon you -- you, a grand priestess of Khura'in.
</p><p>Amara:<br />
...Fear not, Rayfa. You will have plenty of time in which to make amends. O ho ho ho. Perhaps you could start with one of your famous shoulder rubs?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Nahyuta:<br />
Her Benevolence... ...has taken to calling me "Braid Head." Even worse, she trembles and her face turns red when she speaks to me. What have I done to deserve such animosity? While it is true that I am merciless within the Hall of Justice... ...to be given such a dismissive name... is entirely uncalled for! Oh, what am I to do? .........Perhaps I shall consult Apollo about this.
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
...How is he doing, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Great. He's a respectable lawyer in his own right. He even has his own practice called <span style="color:#E16935">Justice Law Offices</span>.
</p><p>???:<br />
...Thank you. This wouldn't have been possible without you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, before I forget... I made a copy of this photo for you.
</p><p>???:<br />
A photo...? Oh! ............Jove. ........................ It is so good to see him again...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Don't you think it's about time we told them the truth? After all, they've both grown into fine young people now.
</p><p>???:<br />
Yes, you're right. Perhaps it's about time they knew...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Mr. Wright,<br />
I can't believe it's already been a few months since I decided to stay. I'm sorry I haven't been good about keeping in touch, but things have been really hectic. Rebuilding a legal system I'm not yet familiar with has been a real challenge. But I will say, it's given me plenty of work to keep me busy.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Have you not given the autopsy report even a cursory glance, Mr. Justice?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
A-ha ha. It's just, I have fifteen clients on my plate right now... ...though I probably shouldn't have accepted all fifteen at the same time...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Oh, please. Are you going to help me rebuild Khura'in's legal system or not? If you are, we need to move through this case backlog faster.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Y-Yeah, I know, but...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Besides, those fifteen are only the beginning. There are ten more awaiting your services.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I, too, have friends and acquaintances seeking legal representation. And being that you are the only lawyer in the country, I told them to contact you. I estimate it will only add about sixteen clients to your caseload.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh? Huh? N-Now, wait just one minute...
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I have been handing out advertisements for your new office. They read: "From legal advice to investigating extramarital affairs -- even yak mailking! For a limited time only, these services and more are free down at Justice Law Offices!" I have already received requests from 380 new clients.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I... I'm going to have to say something, aren't I?)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
.........Heh. I trust you did your "Chords of Steel" exercises this morning. Well, go on. There is no need to hold back.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ha ha ha ha! Now that you mention it, we have yet to hear you shout today.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes, and I have grown quite drowsy from these tedious proceedings. I could use a loud something to wake me up. Do not disappoint me, Horn Head.
</p>
<hr />
<p>There's really only one thing to say at a time like this... It's a word I've said countless times in my career, but one I'll never tire of...

I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Regarding the murder of Minister Inga and the assassination of Queen Amara... ...the defense has failed to counter the charges filed by the prosecution. I will now pass judgment on the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...and his defenders, Apollo Justice and Phoenix Wright. This court finds these three individuals...

In the end, we never did get the truth out of Queen Amara. Minister Inga's true killer disappeared into the shadows of Khura'inese history... ...and Dhurke was found guilty of a twenty-three-year-old crime. After all that... The truth we'd been seeking... was lost for all time.

<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
This trial may have proven Dhurke's innocence... ...but we failed to prove who Minister Inga's true killer was. And the truth of what happened twenty-three years ago will remain shrouded in mystery. It was all because we failed to prove Ga'ran's guilt. After that trial, we were forced underground in order to escape Ga'ran's agents... ...and I joined Nahyuta and the Defiant Dragons in their efforts to overthrow Ga'ran. A dragon never yields... We fight on with Dhurke's creed in our hearts. And dream of the day revolution comes to Khura'in...
