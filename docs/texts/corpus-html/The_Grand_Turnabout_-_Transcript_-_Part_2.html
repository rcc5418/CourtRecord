<p>Powers:<br />
Uh, umm. Could you please give it a rest already?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
The heck? I'm tellin' y'all, it's best for all y'alls sake to come clean!
</p><p>Nicole:<br />
The staff has their lips sealed shut as the reporters continue their tenacious negotiations!
</p><p>Officer:<br />
...If you're not here to cooperate with the investigation, I must ask you to vacate the premises.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
...Put a sock in it, copper! Y'all couldn't even stop Moozilla's invasion!
</p><p>Nicole:<br />
Not only did they secretly raise a giant monster, but now the staff is tryin' to cover it up...?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Like I said, we haven't been raising any monsters here at the film lot!
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
But ain't ya said ya done saw Gourdy yerself!?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Sure, I saw it... but it's not like we were keeping it at the film lot!
</p><p>???:<br />
Mind if we butt in?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Powers:<br />
And John...!
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Oh! Y'all come here to search for the monster too?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
We're searching for a criminal, not a monster. Lang Zi says: "The darkness inside a criminal's heart can be likened to a monster!" Well, when it comes to killing people, criminals aren't much different from monsters.
</p><p>Officer:<br />
A-Agent Lang! This is a problem! I can't let outsiders enter the crime scene...!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
These are all key figures in the case. I'd like them to be here when the investigation resumes.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang. Regarding what you said about resuming the investigation... Where do you intend to start?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
We'll start by reviewing the case. Today, the body of President Huang was found here at the film lot. The president's whereabouts from two nights ago are still unknown.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It seems he snuck out from under the eyes of his bodyguards and ventured outside.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
And that night was the last time he was seen alive. It was when he met with you, Judge Courtney, on the roof of the <span style="color:#E16935">Grand Tower</span>.
</p><p>John:<br />
!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
......
</p><p>Lang:<br />
So, why did you meet with the president?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That... I cannot say.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You can't tell us, even under suspicion of murder?)</span>
</p><p>John:<br />
...Can't say? Why not?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ms. Courtney! If you don't say anything, you'll be more suspicious!
</p><p>Lang:<br />

Hah! She must have a reason to clam up! I think you're somehow involved in the president's assassination.

The president's body was only discovered today. That still leaves a blank of one whole day after Judge Courtney met with him unaccounted for!
</p><p>Lang:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Don't be so impatient. We're gonna fill in that blank right here, right now. The evening on that blank day in question is what's important... What happened here last night? So, why don't you tell us? John Marsh!
</p><p>John:<br />
Me?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
We know you were here last night.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Wh-What... John was... here?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Between that little missy's testimony and the footprints we found, we can easily prove it.
</p><p>Penny:<br />
John, you were rehearsing here last night, right?
</p><p>John:<br />
...You were spying on me?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Ah, umm, I'm sorry. I just came to check up on things. You really shouldn't be staying up so late, you know...
</p><p>John:<br />
Mind your own business.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
John Marsh! That young lady was worried about you. You will not speak to her like that!
</p><p>John:<br />
.......Sorry.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
How many times have I told you to be more mindful of the way you speak?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It is just me, or does Ms. Courtney's personality seem kind of different?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
She seems to be as strict with her own son as she is with those who violate the law.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Are you listening to me? And earlier, as well...
</p>
<hr />
<p>John:<br />
.....
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
You should always bear that in mind, no matter the occasion...
</p><p>Lang:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Can we get on with the investigation already?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ah! ...Pardon me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(For Judge Courtney to get carried away like that... This must be her motherly side.)</span> Agent Lang. Do you suspect John?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
All I want is the truth. Why was the president killed...? And I want to know who killed him... I'll do whatever it takes to find out.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It seems the president was like family to him...)</span> John... Would it be alright if we asked you a few questions?
</p><p>John:<br />
...Sure. It's fine. I've got nothing to hide anyway.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- John's Rehearsal --</span></center>
<p>John:<br />
I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers.<br />
They're reshooting the scene today, so...<br />
Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all.<br />
I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtney:<br />
You were rehearsing alone that late at night...? John. When I called you last night, you told me you were at the hotel...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You called him? About what time was that?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I believe it was around 11 PM. I require him to call me every night. That's our rule whenever he stays away from home.
</p><p>John:<br />
...The truth is, I was at the film lot during that time.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
So you lied to me...!
</p><p>John:<br />
.......... I'm sorry.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ms. Courtney sure is angry. I think it's admirable that he practiced on his own, even if he hid it from his mom.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm sure she was simply worried. Who knows what could have happened to him, out alone so late at night? And in reality, he did get caught up in yesterday's incident...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But John said, "<span style="color:#E16935">there wasn't anything out of the ordinary</span>", right?

Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case?

Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left.

The Moozilla costume...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Try comparing it with the one over there right now.

Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly.

WHAAAAAAAT!

Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...?

It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use...

Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In here?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, that's right! Judge Courtney! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume!

I... I did no such thing!

It's true, Judge Courtney's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it!

I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof.

Hmm... she pushes him off.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot.

Kay, it's the opposite.

<p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
In that case, what should we do?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You have a problem with that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hmm... Where have I seen this?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What's the matter, Kay?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...)</span>

Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm...

You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints?

Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then, maybe...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself.

It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! That's when John came to practice!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging!

As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...John still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unfortunately, the "Gourdy" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />

</p><p>Nicole:<br />
M-Mentor!
</p><p>Kay:<br />

</p><p>Lotta:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out.
</p><p>Forensics:<br />
Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Good! Show it to me!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lang:<br />
"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure." So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was <span style="color:#E16935">crushed to death</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I thought as much...)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that <span style="color:#E16935">gunpowder residue</span> was found on his right hand.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, <span style="color:#E16935">gunpowder residue</span>. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.)</span> Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Courtney should be cleared up, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Courtney met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's a relief!
</p><p>Lang:<br />

...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Agent Lang?)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's right. You killed him, didn't you? John Marsh!
</p><p>John:<br />
........
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the "footprints". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face.
</p><p>John:<br />
..............
</p><p>Lang:<br />
He looks pretty shaken up to me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like he hit the mark... but John doesn't want to talk about it.)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang. What is your intention?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal.

Agent Lang. You would suspect John enough to go that far...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(As long as John's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.)</span> Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct?

It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks!

Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something.

There was a huge hammer in his garage too.

Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed?

Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.

Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too!

I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, why didn't you just answer it here?

<p>Kay:<br />
It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. That is, if we decide to take John's words at face value... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)</span>

<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
His clothes were "spotless"...?
</p><p>John:<br />
Y... Yeah, that's right. You got a problem with it, old man?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
John. It is painfully obvious that you are desperately trying to hide something from me.
</p><p>John:<br />
Wh-Wh-What are you going on about!? I-I'm not hiding anything!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You are hiding... ...something about this <span style="color:#E16935">yellow stain</span> on the president's clothes, correct?
</p><p>John:<br />
!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why did you leave it entirely out of your testimony? The fact you made no mention of it only serves to cast more suspicion upon yourself!
</p><p>John:<br />
...Ugh! Th-That's because...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I hope you have a convincing explanation.

........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Judge Courtney?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Allow me to explain.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why are you...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The yellow stain left on the president's chest... ...is almost certainly <span style="color:#E16935">Lion Lily</span> pollen.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Lion Lily...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
When I met with the president on the roof of the Grand Tower two nights ago... ...I brought him a bouquet of Lion Lilies. Lion Lilies are beautiful flowers with stunning golden petals. Some of the pollen from the lilies must have gotten on the president's suit.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh? But... ...I didn't see any lilies in the security footage though?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
They were simply obscured by the president's body.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why did you bring a bouquet?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Th-That..... I... I cannot say.
</p><p>Lang:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey, hey! You're keeping way too many secrets! You won't tell us why you met with the president OR the reason you brought him flowers!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.....My apologies. However, I did give him the bouquet. That much is true.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But when the president's body was discovered, we didn't find any flowers.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I... I honestly don't know how that could be...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! Hey, Ms. Judge! All your answers have been too vague... You "can't say" this, and you "don't know" that! Do you accept flimsy testimony like that in your trials!?

</p><p>John:<br />
Hey! Cut it out!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
J... John!
</p><p>John:<br />
I... threw the flowers away.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You threw them away? So, there were flowers near the body when you found it?
</p><p>John:<br />
.....Yeah, that's right. They were right on top of the president's body. They had been crushed as flat as pancakes, though...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! I see! So the flowers were squashed by Moozilla's head too...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And a large amount of pollen got stuck to the president's suit. ...That seems to be the gist of it. However, why did you go out of your way to dispose of the flowers?
</p><p>John:<br />
..........No reason.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So John's not going to tell us anything either...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I guess mother and son both have a lot of secrets, huh.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That is not true. At the very least, I can tell you why John threw away those flowers.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
John. You saw me leaving the house with those flowers in hand, did you not?
</p><p>John:<br />
........
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! I get it! John saw the flowers and thought of his mom!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...He threw them away in order to protect Judge Courtney from being suspected.
</p><p>John:<br />
Th-That's not true. You're all wrong!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...That was his worst lie yet...)</span>

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I often decorate our house with those flowers. The bouquet must have reminded him of me.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
So the pup just happens to find the flowers from his mother's bouquet on top of the body... That's why he threw them away and kept silent about the body? Hah! That's a tidy little story if I've ever heard one.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And what's wrong with that!? I suppose you prefer untidy, messy stories, Agent Lang?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Don't tell me you've forgotten already, Missy? This pup confessed that he caused the monster's head to fall last night.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oooh... That's true, but...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
He's currently the only suspect in the president's murder!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm. It is true that there are many reasons to suspect John...)</span> ...However! There is someone other than John who is far more suspicious!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What'd you say?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
John himself was kidnapped by that very person not too long ago.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
A refrigerated warehouse?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
That's right, pal! The refrigeration wasn't turned on, so he wasn't about to freeze to death... ...but if he hadn't yelled out for help, we would've never found him.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Once the sleeping drugs wore off, he was finally able to call out for help.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Sleeping drugs... huh. If I recall correctly, when you were kidnapped...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's right! There was a bottle lying on the floor of the refrigerated warehouse... I think it was the same thing that was used one me not long ago. That <span style="color:#E16935">Sleepy zZz</span> stuff! It's super powerful!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Sleeping Drugs data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
How about it, Agent Lang? John is clearly a victim. There is a <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> at work behind the scenes of this case.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="image"><img alt="NotsofastDS" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="256" height="191" data-image-name="NotsofastDS.png" data-image-key="NotsofastDS.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/2/2f/NotsofastDS.png/revision/latest?cb=20190210002837" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I don't know anything about this so-called "<span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>". You say they were here last night?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I... still don't know for sure yet...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! It's not like you to be so vague, Mr. Prosecutor!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Indeed, I still don't have any evidence that ties the mastermind to this murder... Is there someone else? Is there anyone besides John who had the opportunity to murder the president...? That's it...!)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...As I thought. In the end, that pup is our only suspect.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Isn't there one more suspect, Agent Lang...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What's this!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Didn't we prove it earlier? Last night, there was one more person here!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.....Blaise Debeste. You're saying he's the one who did it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Last night, John was not alone. Blaise Debeste was here too. Shouldn't we consider him to be a new suspect?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Blaise Debeste... killed the president!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's entirely possible.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
........ .....Blaise Debeste... It can't be...! The same guy from 12 years ago?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm? 12 years ago? That keeps popping up...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lang:<br />
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Roland:<br />
Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang! What happened 12 years ago?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.....Nothing that concerns you.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
On the contrary. It might just have some sort of connection with this case.
</p><p>Lang:<br />

.....Hmph. And I suppose you have some proof, Mr. Prosecutor? Show me evidence that there's a connection between this case and the one 12 years ago!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Evidence... you say?

If you don't have any evidence, then there's no point in talking about it.

Sure... The <span style="color:#E16935">SS-5 Incident</span>... The incident occurred on a winter day 12 years ago... It was the 10th of February.

The <span style="color:#E16935">SS-5 Incident</span> was the case of President Huang's kidnapping. They demanded a ransom of <span style="color:#E16935">100 million dollars</span>.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
100 million!? ...Wait, just how much is that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's such a large amount, she's having trouble visualizing it.)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That night, my old man was the last person to meet with the president. They were together at the Zheng Fa embassy until midnight on February 10th. After that, no one knows what the president was doing up until he was kidnapped. With the president's life at stake, the Zheng Fa government frantically gathered the money. After that, the ransom was delivered and the president was returned safe and sound.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So... President Huang has been the president since 12 years ago. That's really amazing.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Well... being in office for so long is just a small part of how amazing the man is.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Lang seemed a bit happy when he said that.)</span> And, what happened to the kidnappers?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Well, a top secret covert investigation was carried out, then a secret trial was held.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A trial? Does that mean the suspect was caught?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The suspect was... <span style="color:#E16935">Patricia Roland</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
! Then, the reason you came to the prison a few days ago...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah. I was put on extended leave from Interpol... ...so I decided to go back and reinvestigate what happened 12 years ago. First, I had to get a look at the face of my target.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...So the trial 12 years ago ended with a Not Guilty verdict.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah... Back then, my old man was in charge of every aspect of the president's security. He took responsibility for the kidnapping and was relieved of his post as bodyguard... ...but he continued to investigate as a regular police officer, until... he finally found the culprit. And it was none other than <span style="color:#E16935">Patricia Roland</span>. There was no way she could be innocent! However, the result was a Not Guilty verdict. In the end, the case went unsolved... Crushed in both body and soul... my old man resigned from the police.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What was the basis for arresting Patricia Roland?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
There was a lot of evidence. At least, that's what I think. But, I can't see those documents for myself... ...so that's where my story ends.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What should we do? With only this much information... ...even the <span style="color:#E16935">Little Thief</span> would have a hard time producing a re-creation.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ngh... Is there really nothing we can do...?)</span>

</p><p>???:<br />
Looks like you could use some help.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Who's that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Franziska!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And Mr. Shields too!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
We finished up with the trial and finally managed to catch up with you guys.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Here, take this.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Ah! It's the <span style="color:#E16935">case files for the SS-5 Incident</span>, sir!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">SS-5 Incident Files jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
When Roland mentioned "12 years ago" during the trial, it caught my interest. I looked into it immediately, and got it touch with Interpol.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I expected no less from you, Franziska.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Don't get the wrong idea, Miles Edgeworth. I didn't prepare these documents for you, the former prosecutor. I did it for the sake of the investigator taking up the case his father left behind.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Sis...! But, I thought information on the SS-5 Incident was restricted to the public.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That restriction was placed by the prosecutor in charge of the case: <span style="color:#E16935">Blaise Debeste</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Blaise Debeste was the prosecutor in charge!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Him...!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
However... ...as a result of the trial just now, Blaise's authority has been revoked. It's all thanks to his son...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Sebastian...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(By bringing down his father, the door to this past case has been opened.)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Prosecutor Debeste is currently wrapping things up in Patricia Roland's trial. He told me to relay this message to you. "Leave Pops and his cohorts to me. You guys just take care of the case on your end."
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. He's become quite reliable, right before our very eyes...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Truly...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Alrighty then! This is perfect! Now that we have the files, just leave the re-creation to me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. Well then, let us begin. According to these documents... ...it appears that the incident took place right in front of the Tower Plaza.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then let's head to the plaza right away!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">April 6, 3:25 PM<br />Outside Grand Tower<br />Tower Plaza</span></center>
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay. Would you please activate the Little Mr. Thief?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Right! With these case files, re-creating everything should be a snap! Where should I start?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Where indeed. According to these documents... ...it seems there was a witness to the kidnapping of the president. A freelance journalist by the name of Jack Cameron. However... ...he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was murdered by the culprit...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
So that would mean the place he saw the president at was <span style="color:#E16935">here</span>.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Here? ...At the Grand Tower?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No. The Grand Tower was only built around a year ago, Kay. Before that, this place contained mostly old abandoned buildings. However, 12 years ago, this place was...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! Now you're finally talking about some stuff that I know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah... 12 years ago, at the very spot was... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">Happy Family Home</span>.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
What's that, pal?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
It was a place where children who had lost their parents could live... ...or to put ot simply, it was an <span style="color:#E16935">orphanage</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So the president was kidnapped at that <span style="color:#E16935">orphanage</span>...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...and, the head of that facility at the time was Patricia Roland. ...Apparently, Roland always referred to it as her <span style="color:#E16935">Home</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
It seems that suspicion would naturally fall upon her...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang... The darkness that remains from the SS-5 Incident still casts a shadow on the present case.)</span> Kay, I'd like you to input the investigation data from Jack Cameron's murder case. We can probably assume that he was killed by one of the kidnappers.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So if we solve the murder case, we'll know who the kidnappers were, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely. I'm counting on you.
</p>
<hr />
<p>John:<br />
Wh-What the heck is this!? Everything's green!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I've come to expect such reactions...)</span> This is a re-creation of the grounds of the facility that stood here 12 years ago... ...based on the documents from the police investigation.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I re-created the scene to show what it looked like when police arrived at 7 AM the next day!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...It appears a fair amount of snow had piled up here.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah. I heard that the footprints in the snow were prime pieces of evidence. The snow fell during the day, on the day of the incident.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the snow only fell before the crime took place... ...which means the footprints wouldn't have been erased by any further snow. I must make sure to pay close attention to these footprints.)</span>

The report from Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste. It said that something was "<span style="color:#E16935">laid to rest in front of the flowerbed</span>".
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So Blaise was following Ms. Roland's instructions to dig it up? But, why would he dig up three holes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The report didn't state which of three flowerbeds the item was in front of.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh. So Blaise didn't know exactly where to dig... That's why he had to dig up all three spots!

Most likely, yes. I'm sure Blaise himself was none too happy about that.

Yes. And the only witness, Jack Cameron, was then subsequently murdered. However, when you consider that this case was classified as top secret...

The law makes exceptions for extenuating circumstances. It understands a mother's heart. I'd say perhaps your Goddess sympathizes with you more than you think.

That's right! Umm, apparently Mr. Cameron gave his eyewitness testimony over the cell phone.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

After Cameron found the president, it seems that he called his girlfriend. But she didn't answer the phone, so Cameron left a message on her answering machine.

Agent Lang, may I ask... ...what was the name of Mr. Cameron's beloved?

</p><p>Courtney:<br />

This was why she was seeking revenge for 12 long years...

<p>Courtney:<br />
The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
But, Ms. Crane tried to get revenge on Blaise, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
She may have wanted to get revenge on him for covering up the kidnapping case. Or perhaps she thought Blaise himself was the kidnapper.

Right! I'll re-create the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo!

<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Cameron is standing in the middle of the flowerbeds...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...and the president and his kidnapper are standing on the road.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
My old man based his initial investigation on this man's eyewitness testimony. As a result, it led him to believe that the kidnapping and this facility were related.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And that's how... he came to suspect the head of the orphanage, Patricia Roland.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah... But in court, Blaise Debeste treated this testimony as if it meant nothing.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why would he do that?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The president and his kidnapper were not standing inside the orphanage grounds. So a connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping was difficult to prove.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I see. It's not like they were seen inside the orphanage, after all...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Tch! No matter how much evidence the detectives gather at the crime scene... ...it doesn't mean squat if the prosecutor won't use it in court! Blaise Debeste had some kind of connection with Patricia Roland. I figure they had some kind of deal going on.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
In other words, you think that Blaise was <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Was Blaise a kidnapper?

However, your father was convinced that Patricia Roland was the culprit... Your father was a highly capable investigator, I presume? Might he have had some other basis for his conclusion besides the eyewitness testimony?
</p><p>Lang:<br />

The victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was <span style="color:#E16935">stained with blood</span>. In other words, he grabbed the button after he was attacked. For example, if we were to picture it in this way... After being struck in the back of the head, Mr. Cameron lost his balance. As he was falling, he reached out his hand towards the nearby snowman. However, it could not support his weight, and he collapsed while still grasping the button.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The one in charge of this case was Blaise Debeste. It would have been simple for him to falsify that information.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But! Wouldn't it be faster to just clean up the bloodstains, rather than falsify the information?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
He wouldn't be able to do that. Think about it... Blaise knew that Mr. Cameron's body would be discovered here. In which case, the forensic department would naturally become involved.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! A luminol reaction! They would've discovered it with the power of science!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely. It would have been difficult to completely erase all traces of the blood. However, falsifying the results of a blood test would be much easier in comparison. He would just have to switch the results from the forensics reports.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Aww, what a bummer... Knowing those documents I read were falsified. Err, it looks like Mr. Cameron's clothes were completely soaked in blood.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm. If the blood scattered here got onto Cameron's clothes... ...that would mean, at the time, the bloodstains here had not dried yet.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I see. So then, this certain somebody's blood... ...was splattered here just a short while before Mr. Cameron was murdered!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. That's exactly right. <span style="color:#0070C0">(However, if that's the case... ...wouldn't a new contradiction arise in this re-creation...?)</span>

Huh? You mean this bloodstain?

Do you see how this bloodstain is broken up by the remains of the fire? This is proof that the fire occurred after the blood had scattered around the area.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh? But I thought the fire occurred before the murder...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It seems that information is suspect as well. If the fire had broken out after the murder...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
! ...then the child who started the fire should have seen the body and the bloodstains.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why then, did they not come forward as a witness? It's likely that would have put Blaise at a great disadvantage!

Guess we'll need to investigate this fire in more detail. Hey, you!
</p><p>MIB:<br />
Yes, sir!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
There should be some records of the fire in the police department under a different case file! I want you to bring me every last investigation report about the fire!

Understood, Shifu!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Oh, and one more thing...
</p><p>MIB:<br />
What is it, sir?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Contact the House of Lang in Zheng Fa. There should be evidence from this case in my old man's room.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I just remembered... why I recognize this scene. A long time ago, I saw a picture in my old man's room. It was a drawing resembling this scene...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What did you say!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
However, I think it looked like something a child drew.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A child...? Then the artist may have been the culprit behind the fire.

It should still be somewhere in my old man's room. Have them send it over here.

Yeah. He entrusted it to the Lang clan even before the <span style="color:#E16935">SS-5 Incident</span> took place. They'll have to appraise it back home, but by the name of the Lang clan, this is the real deal.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Yeah. You're right.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The re-creation of the past has finished. Were your father's deductions correct?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...My old man took his deductions to the grave. He never told anyone about them. So, who knows if they were right or not.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, what about your own deductions? I would like to hear what you think happened based on the re-creation. In order for us to get closer to the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> of 12 years ago.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah. I was thinking it's about time. I can see it now. My old man's back, real close... I'll catch up to him for sure... ...to the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> that my old man uncovered!

There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.<br />
The stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.<br />
However, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.<br />
If Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.<br />
Afterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.

It's this. Why did they need to take a <span style="color:#E16935">fake photo</span>? Why would they go through all that trouble and even make the president take part in the photo?

...That's true. However, the answer to that riddle must lie somewhere within... Once we get past the layers upon layers of deductions, we shall surely reach it.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If he hadn't been there, you say? That's an interesting theory. Care to explain in more detail?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
It's simple. Cameron was killed because he saw the kidnapping. The kidnapping itself was a success. If he hadn't been there, no blood would've been spilled.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... No blood would have been spilled?)</span>

You make it sound like it was his own fault for being there.

Kay, that's not it. When Agent Lang's trying to say is... ...simply, besides Mr. Cameron, there was no other casualties at the crime scene.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh, was that all? Of course, that's obvious. The president was kidnapped, but... ...once the ransom money was paid, he was returned safe and sound.

That's also an important point. I'd like to take another good clean look at the information.

Yeah, I'm with you there. Let's start with what Cameron saw before he was murdered. Cameron witnessed the president and the kidnapper in front of the orphanage.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, the culprit wanted to conceal the connection between the incident and the orphanage.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's right. That's why Cameron's original roll of film was disposed of... ...and a fake photo was taken of them standing outside the grounds of the orphanage.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. And Cameron's body was then moved to match the photo.

Last night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands. That item was not the ransom... It was something far more important.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! So Blaise unburied the...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...the real president's body! The possibility is quite high.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What'd you saaaayy!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The bones from the body buried 12 years ago would have still remained. According to Mr. Powers, construction was to begin soon at this lot. That was the deadline... ...both for the movie and <span style="color:#E16935">retrieval of the body</span>.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Because they would've found the body when they started the construction!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang! Let us search the footprints that Blaise dug up!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Yeah. If the body was buried there, there'd be traces of it. Hey! Somebody call forensics!

I have the results of the search! We've found traces in the dirt that suggest a body was buried here!

</p><p>Forensics:<br />
We also recovered the skeletal remains that Blaise Debeste dug up. They were in his home. In addition to the bone structure, the dental records and the bone fractures all match up. We can confirm that it was indeed President Huang!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So the real President Huang was indeed killed 12 years ago. The SS-5 Incident was a murder.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Monster's Footprints data updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So the SS-5 Incident was actually a murder incident! But there's so much information, it's way too confusing...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. Let us take this opportunity to review the details of the case.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
First, the real president came to the orphanage, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Twelve years ago... ...the true President Huang visited the orphanage in order to meet his son. The footsteps in the snow that we thought belonged to Mr. Cameron... ...were most likely made by the president at that time. President Huang was supposed to meet his son here... However, the one who actually showed up was the assassin, Sirhan Dogen.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
He came here to meet his son, but was murdered instead... How horrible...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A man like Dogen... shows no mercy. ...And after that, the second tragedy occurred.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You mean Mr. Cameron's murder?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. Mr. Cameron saw the decisive moment. After the real president was killed by Dogen... ...his body was carried to the rear courtyard by the team of kidnappers. Mr. Cameron must have witnessed that moment... ...from the orphanage entrance. Although, he himself believed that he had actually witnessed a kidnapping. Furthermore, by this time...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...the body double, who had come to meet up with Blaise and Ms. Roland... ...was already standing behind Mr. Cameron.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And then the witness to the incident, Mr. Cameron...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...was killed by the body double. So, was Mr. Cameron's corpse also carried by the body double?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, that seems likely.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But, there wasn't anything at the crime scene that looked like the body double's footprints!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. I've already figured out how he accomplished that. There is a piece of evidence that would've made it possible. <span style="color:green">What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?</span>

Argh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It appears this wasn't it... The body double's footprints should have been left at the scene, but they aren't... On the other hand, the victim's footprints are clearly there... I already have the evidence to tie these two facts together!)</span>
</p><p><i>Leads back to:</i><br />
"What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?"
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse. After Mr. Cameron was killed... ...the president's body double carried him into the middle of the garden. I suspect the body double was wearing the same shoes as the real president at the time. If he made sure to step precisely on top of the footprints left by the real president...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! Since the shoes were the same... ...there would only be one set of footprints left behind in the snow. I think I've got a pretty good grasp on the SS-5 Incident now. But, there's still one thing I don't get.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What's that?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Why did they need to stage the abduction?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Because Mr. Cameron witnessed the incident. He saw the president at the orphanage. He left behind witness testimony on Ms. Crane's answering machine. Even Blaise couldn't make that disappear. Ergo, the body double needed a reason for the president to have been at the orphanage.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And that's why they prepared the fake kidnapping charade.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The people in the fake photo are the body double, and most likely, Patricia Roland.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
The person in the coat is Ms. Roland? What makes you say that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The two would have to leave the orphanage in order to take the picture. Just like when he moved the body, the double used the real president's footprints.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! So the second set of footprints must belong to the person in the coat!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. We originally believed that those footprints belonged to Cameron's killer. They were size 7 footprints, too small for Blaise's feet. Thus, we can presume that the person playing the part of the kidnapper was Patricia Roland. Hidden in the shadow of the presidential kidnapping was a presidential assassination...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I see... So that's why my old man...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why he... what?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The old man must have realized that a murder had taken place. ...After all, he had the kid's drawing.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
However, that picture was never presented as evidence...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your father likely took it from the young witness during the investigation and hid it.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
He had to have known that Huang was dead. But what if he had revealed that back then?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Reveal the death of the president, the backbone of Zheng Fa? It would have caused chaos...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...and that's why my old man took the secret to his grave. He even took the blame for the kidnapping, knowing that would be the fall of the House of Lang!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So this is the truth that Agent Lang's father hid 12 years ago...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And now, it's all become clear.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">SS-5 Incident Case Files updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
...Is that really the case, I wonder?
</p><p>Kay:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Who's there!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
How can you just brazenly show up here!? Who do you think you are, pal!?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
I found the conversation most intriguing, and I just... well...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. Are you feeling nostalgic about an old murder of yours?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You're the one who killed Huang...!
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh heh. Nostalgia? I think not. You were speaking about the person I am searching for.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're searching for someone?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
I escaped from prison in order to meet with a young acolyte... The one who wore the <span style="color:#E16935">red raincoat</span>...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">red raincoat</span>!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wh-Who is this person?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
I suspect that it's the same person as the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> you are searching for.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The red hood?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dogen:<br />
Don't they seem surprised, Anubis? Yes, yes they are, my boy. Twelve years ago, this young acolyte saved my life...
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Dogen's Savior --</span></center>
<p>Dogen:<br />
Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang.<br />
However, my life was also targeted on that day.<br />
The body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.<br />
Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.<br />
But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
So your client was indeed the body double, who was the main perpetrator of the crime.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. It was a long time ago, but I remember his words even now.
</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:green">There have been countless attempts on my life. Not just once or twice. Countless! And yet, why must I be the only one to face the danger? When I stand before the people, I garner the same respect as the president does. Tell me, just what is the difference between him and me!?</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dogen:<br />
The difference was great. While the voice and style of speech may be the same... Keh heh heh. One can mimic the body, but the heart cannot be reproduced.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose his own weaknesses cost him in his quest to become a leader.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Knightley:<br />
Now that Rooke's gone, I'm in charge!
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
I'm not sure if you're as capable as Rooke was...
</p><p>Knightley:<br />
Wh-What are you saying!? I'm totally the leader now!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmph... perhaps the king and his knight were not so different after all.)</span>
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
The double believed that the president's only weakness was a woman called Amy. To find the woman, he needed the assistance of someone from this country.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, he joined forced with Blaise...
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
After determining her whereabouts, he simply waited for the right opportunity.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That chance came with the meeting at the orphanage.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Indeed. The director of the orphanage was bribed and brought in as an accomplice.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He must be referring to Patricia Roland.)</span>
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Well. Given what I've told you, do you realize the whereabouts of the young acolyte now?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You mean the boy who saved you. But, how do you know that he is the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
...That day, the young one caused a fire at the garden of the orphanage.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! You're talking about the kid who started the fire as a prank!
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
A prank...? Keh heh heh, not at all. On that night 12 years ago, the young acolyte was hiding inside the igloo... It seems he witnessed Patricia Roland and Blaise moving the body from his hiding place. Apparently, he heard them talking during that time. It would seem that they were planning to kill me because I knew the truth. He immediately came to the main hall to tell me that. I learned this about the young acolyte some time later... It seems he was wearing a <span style="color:#E16935">red raincoat</span> at the time. He led me out of the main hall. And then, the young acolyte... ...said he was going to get rid of our footprints. So he scattered some lamp oil near the igloo over the snow. Then he boldly set the oil ablaze!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! No way! So he set the fire in order to...!
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
All their focus was diverted towards the burning flames. I took the opportunity to escape through the rear exit.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, the boy in the red raincoat is the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> behind this case?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Exactly. Isn't that right, Anubis? Yes, boy. Yes it is.

You admitted that rather easily.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him!

</p><p>Dogen:<br />
On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Two children?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage...

</p><p>Dogen:<br />
You are right about that. For Anubis, "roll over" means first biting the victim's foot...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!

Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks.

<p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Dogen and that "acolyte" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Perhaps there is a hint to the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind's</span> motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Dogen is one of the few people who knows the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago...
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What makes sense?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
They lost their memories?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. <span style="color:#0070C0">(However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind's</span> identity...)</span> Dogen... Would you please continue your story?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh. Very well.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Dogen and the "Acolyte" --</span></center>
<p>Dogen:<br />
I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.<br />
Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.<br />
Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.<br />
I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And Ms. Roland was the warden of Mr. Dogen's prison.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears.
</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:green">I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want John to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting.</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Huang:<br />
...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone...
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life.
</p><p>Huang:<br />
.........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dogen:<br />
I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see John's horns?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He said that the president made "preparations" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word "preparations" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.)</span> ........That's it!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using John!)</span>
</p><p>John:<br />
..........
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So Dogen cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...)</span>
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son.

In other words, you contacted him from prison?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A post-office box...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He must mean the prison warden... Patricia Roland.)</span> Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences?

</p><p>Ray:<br />
Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />

Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Dogen's chess opponent and the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>, was Knightley?

Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then, would you please tell us what you wrote?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So then, how does your handmade dog piece move?

Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming?

Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts.

OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this "acolyte"?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. Dogen himself has not yet made that clear. <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's important is the thread connecting Dogen and this "acolyte": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)</span>

<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Correct. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
What? That... cannot be.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What do you mean...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Could another person have acted as a middleman between Dogen and Knightley?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Dogen wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Dogen.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, that is indeed true.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Correspondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual... Dogen, were the letters that reached you...
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
They were in <span style="color:#E16935">braille</span>, of course.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well.

You're saying there's someone else who's the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You mean, <span style="color:#E16935">Dane Gustavia's son</span>...? But, who the heck is he?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
......
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Sir! I've put out an APB on Dogen! All available police units will be searching for him!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> right now?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
A request...? What is it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Roger that, sir!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>, we may require assistance from a certain someone... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!)</span>

<p>Regina:<br />
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Are you guys here for the show?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Keyes... Ms. Berry...
</p><p>Simon:<br />
You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your "performance" has already surprised me, Mr. Keyes.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
..........
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Umm. But he hasn't performed yet...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating.
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Huh!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Who is in charge of the balloon?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Well, th-that would be S-Simon, but... A-Are you saying...!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Keyes. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and "not much of a pilot"?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Keyes.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's not all. You drugged John at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Patricia Roland?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.)</span> We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon:<br />
I'm so sad... Those words were all lies...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simon isn't a bad guy after all...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> the entire case!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simon Keyes. I indict you!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!)</span> So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simon Keyes.
</p><p>Regina:<br />
S-Simon! That's not... true, is it!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Truth or lie... What difference does it make?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Huh!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right?
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Balloon Practice --</span></center>
<p>Simon:<br />
It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.<br />
That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building.<br />
I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.<br />
There's nothing unusual about that, right?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Regina, is that true?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Y-Yup. It was Simon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Was the balloon launched from this tent?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A truck...?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.

Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Keyes!)

Yep! So, Simon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence?

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's it... The <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simon, then...!)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
That's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Though you may have taken it a little too far...)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
You sure look happy. I take it you've found something?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
<span style="color:green">"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!"</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Keyes. Do you happen to like chess?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Hmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> played correspondence chess with Sirhan Dogen.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
If I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Dogen, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There was no way Knightley could have been the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>. The reason being... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Dogen and Knightley.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
So, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Most likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Patricia Roland.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
N-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />

<span style="color:#0070C0">(If only just a scrap of the letters he exchanged with Knightley still remained... ...it'd be decisive evidence!)</span> I'd like to investigate your room. There could be decisive...

</p><p>Simon:<br />
If it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
I'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Without evidence, I won't allow you to cast doubt on my friendship with Knightley!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-Who was that?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Ah! Excuse me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ms. Berry? What's on her mind?)</span>
</p><p>Regina:<br />
I've been... listening in on what you all were saying, and, umm... When you say Mr. Knightley... You mean Simon's friend, Mr. Knightley, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, that's correct... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Does she know something?)</span>
</p><p>Regina:<br />
This morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simon.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
What did you say...!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!)</span> Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter!
</p><p>Regina:<br />
OK! Here you go.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Quick, open it!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is... a correspondence chess letter!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
This is the response to Dogen's last move!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Knightley:<br />
<span style="color:green">Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right?</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late.
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Since the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now, why was this letter addressed to you?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
.....Ngh!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is proof that you were the middleman between Dogen and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Dogen. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Dammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Simon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Hah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend <span style="color:#E16935">18 years ago</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the <span style="color:#E16935">IS-7 Incident</span>?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, "<span style="color:#E16935">My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!</span>"
</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon:<br />
<span style="color:green">Stop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are <span style="color:#E16935">the best in the world</span>...!</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon:<br />
After that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wha...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Your father...!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Horace Knightley was the <span style="color:#E16935">son of the murderer</span> who killed my father!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
But the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover...
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Isaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Heh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So you knew who the culprit was all along?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Hah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Misunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Isaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Is that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. <span style="color:green">This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!</span>

<p>Simon:<br />
What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I want you to take a good look at this ring's design.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...There are two letters inscribed in it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of <span style="color:#E16935">Isaac Dover</span>.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The police had found <span style="color:#E16935">Isaac Dover's son</span> and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is <span style="color:#E16935">Horace Knightley</span>.

That's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well!

Really!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well.

......Yes. Please look forward to it.
</p><p>Knightley:<br />
Alright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Oh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later.
</p><p>Knightley:<br />
Something special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simon.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this.

Huh? Did you say something?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Nope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace.

<p>Simon:<br />
After all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Dogen's footsteps!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This finally proves it... Simon Keyes! You are Dogen's correspondence chess partner... ...and the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> behind this case!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span> behind it all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's finally showing his true colors...!)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
As you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simon Keyes...)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
When I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Patricia. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Exactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Patricia Roland was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Dogen... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Dogen, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
If I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The evidence from Patricia Roland's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...)</span> I see. So that's why you kidnapped John... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence!

Who's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice.

That's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...So you admit it. Your motive was <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span>.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Yeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.....!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Truth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Do you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Yep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that was also a part of his plan...!)</span> If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your...
</p><p>Simon:<br />

</p><p>Simon:<br />
Whoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
How can you say such a thing...!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
It was the same for Patricia Roland. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
That's right! I thought it would bring Dogen to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Patricia to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A pawn... Me...?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
When you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Patricia to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I didn't solve those cases for your sake!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Oh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a <span style="color:#E16935">defense attorney</span>, didn't you?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What did you...!?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
All I had to do was go, "nowaynowaynoway" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
To be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kay...!)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Gyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Absolutely not! That's not true at all!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Now, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, <span style="color:#E16935">Simon himself</span>. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend...
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Say what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However...

<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Instigating Murder? --</span></center>
<p>Simon:<br />
Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?<br />
I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?<br />
If I had said the word "kill" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.<br />
Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
What are you saying!? You kidnapped me!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
I'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's...!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Besides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(You crafty little...!)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Can't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Instigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So we just have to find proof that he directed those murders!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
You make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion.

What'd you say!? You... can't be serious...
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Gyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took John hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting!

</p><p>Simon:<br />
If you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections!

You incited others to commit murder, and they did so. If proof of that was established, you would be charged as if you yourself committed the murders.

...Umm, I know I heard it just a while ago, but what's the technical term again?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's "instigating murder", Kay. Blaise, Patricia Roland, and Knightley... Their crimes are unforgivable, of course. However, the one who pulled the strings from behind the scenes, and drove them all to murder... ...was none other than you, Simon Keyes!

In that case... heh heh heh. I have a theory on how things happened. After that cowardly double fired a shot at me... ...he went and hid in the shadows until Kay fell into the storeroom!

What!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
S-So what if he was hiding!?

</p><p>Simon:<br />
<span style="color:green">"Good grief, you guys still haven't noticed?"</span> What if the body double stayed hidden until Lotta had fainted... ...and then he went down to the 51st floor?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Th... That can't be...!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
<span style="color:green">"Heh... Precisely. The locked room mystery on the roof has been unlocked!"</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Gah... GWOOOOOOOH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(He even said it in my voice!)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Gyaha, Gyaha! Gyahahahah! But wait, there's more... I told the hidden body double about John Marsh. That's why he attacked John the next day during practice, but got himself killed instead. In other words, the one who murdered the body double was none other than John!

...He knew. He knew he was the real president's son.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. And how would he have known that?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Because I told him so. ...In a letter.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-What did you say!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That is a lie!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Yup! It's all a lie!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...But then again, maybe not. Maybe I really did tell him? ...Right, John?
</p><p>John:<br />
It's true that I caused Moozilla's head to fall... ...but... I didn't know about my dad until today!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Oh really... I wonder about that. I found out about the head falling thanks to the bug... Now, if you were the one who caused it to fall... and the body double was crushed to death...
</p><p>John:<br />
Ngh...
</p><p>Simon:<br />
That settles it. You're the culprit. You successfully carried out your revenge. Congratulations! All the pieces of the puzzle are now in place. As Mr. Edgeworth would say... <span style="color:green">"...the logic fits. Now then... any rebuttals?"</span>

Manipulating humans into fighting with each other. Sounds just like me, right?<br />
I did the same thing to Knightley and Blaise.<br />
At any rate, there's no way the body double could've gone for a ride in my balloon.<br />

And who was it that caused the monster's head to fall?
</p>

<p>Simon:<br />
Do you understand now? Who the body double's real killer is? The "truth" that I provided them with gave them a big motive for murder. Get it? Those two tried to kill each other because of the "truth" you're so fond of!

Simon Keyes. Your testimony isn't over yet!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Heh heh... Really? I figured you'd try to stop me, Mr. Edgeworth. You don't have any evidence, do you? Which means... there's no chance for you to win, right? But if you still plan to stop me, you should be prepared to take on this much risk!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wha...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Th-That much!?)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
It's only natural. After all, the fate of the true culprit, John Marsh, is at stake here.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
.....Hey, Miles? Why don'tcha take a nice deep breath?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
M-Mr. Shields?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
At times like this, you should take a breather and think back. "<span style="color:#E16935">Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger</span>." The point of contention between your logic and his claims lies in the body double's escape route. How's about... for example, we think of it like this... What's important isn't whether or not the body double got on the balloon, but rather... ...if we were to assume he did, "<span style="color:#E16935">what circumstances would have allowed for that</span>?"
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(..."<span style="color:#E16935">Turn my thinking around</span>!")</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Well, all I'm doing is a cheap imitation of your old man. Did it help?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Circumstances that would have allowed the body double to get on the balloon...? That's right. The body double not only had a large build,  but he also had a gun. And in spite of that, no traces of sleeping drugs were found in his system... Which means..... it can't be!)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth, are you ready yet? Hope you haven't forgotten about "this".
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You've been fixated on your claims that you manipulated John and the body double. Probably because it's an impossible fantasy of yours. ...After all, even an animal tamer cannot tame the dead. The body double had already been murdered while he was on the roof... ...and the murder weapon was the balloon you were in!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
...Ngh!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I see. Although it floats in the air, that balloon still weighs several hundred pounds.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
When the double threatened you on the rooftop... ...you immediately came up with a plan to defend yourself. And that plan was to crush him with your balloon. Whether the body double wanted to get on, or that he was carrying a gun... None of that matters. Because what you carried in your balloon was the body double's corpse!

Hold on a second, Mr. Edgeworth. You're saying the double was killed on the rooftop <span style="color:#E16935">two nights ago</span>? Well, that simply doesn't match up with the <span style="color:#E16935">time of death</span>!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What... did you say?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
That's not like you at all, Mr. Edgeworth. Take a good look at the autopsy report. The time of death was <span style="color:#E16935">around 11 PM last night</span>!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nngghhh!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
L-Last night...!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
That's right... the very night that Moozilla's head fell!
</p><p>John:<br />
......!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Well, Johnny-boy! Come on! How about telling us the truth! You killed your father, right!? I know the feeling... You hated him, didn't you? Your father who left you all alone forever!
</p><p>John:<br />
Y-You're wrong! I had no idea that guy was my dad!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Not this again. Didn't I personally tell you myself!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ngh! Was my logic wrong?)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to thank you once again. For chasing down Blaise and Patricia and bringing them both to ruin. My revenge was a success, all thanks to your logic!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If only the time of death matched up, then my logic would fit... Perhaps... he did something to <span style="color:#E16935">throw off the time of death</span>?)</span>
</p><p>Simon:<br />
And what's more, <span style="color:#E16935">Dane Gustavia</span>... was it? You even took down the culprit of the IS-7 Incident.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dane Gustavia... and the IS-7 Incident...! That's it! Gustavia killed Dover and <span style="color:#E16935">hid his body in a block of ice</span>...!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct.

<p>Simon:<br />
GYAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It's a shame that I didn't get to witness his destruction!

I did a quick investigation, sir! About the warehouse John was at!

That refrigerated warehouse is currently being rented by... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">Berry Big Circus</span>, just as Mr. Edgeworth said!

We are renting a refrigerated warehouse to store the animal's food, but... ...I don't know much about the place. After all... I let Simon handle everything.

</p><p>Regina:<br />
Kyaaaah! S-Simon... how scary!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What a shame... It seems your desperate actions after the crime were in vain. If the body was found in the warehouse, suspicion would've fallen on you, the one in charge. That's why you specifically moved the body back to the Grand Tower, wasn't it?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Ngh!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, us finding John confined at the warehouse was a fatal mistake on your part.

Oh? Please do tell.

Isn't that obvious!? Evidence that I killed the body double with the balloon! You can't present it, can you? After all, there's no way such evidence could possibly exist!

When John found the body... ...a <span style="color:#E16935">bouquet of Lion Lilies</span> was there as well.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Lion Lilies? The flowers from Zheng Fa that represent the bond between parent and child...?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
That's your evidence? Surely, they must be buried under a mountain of garbage by now. Moreover, the one who threw it away was John himself. That's not much of a bond now, is it?
</p><p>John:<br />
Grrr... That language of flowers stuff has nothing to do with this!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Calm down, John. Certainly, you may have thrown the flowers away. However, I believe those emotions remain as strong as ever. Those bonds will surely protect you from that man, in the form of my final piece of evidence...
</p><p>Simon:<br />
What..... the heck are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Those flowers were crushed... Ergo, they must have come into contact with the murder weapon! Perhaps we'll find the <span style="color:#E16935">very same pollen</span> still stuck to the basket of your balloon?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Nowaynowaynoway! You guys examined the basket just a few moments ago. If there had been any yellow pollen stuck on there, wouldn't you have noticed it then?

...Mr. Keyes. Evidence is not restricted to what you can see with the naked eye.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ema!
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Yes!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Would you perform one more scientific investigation for us?
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Leave it to me! The balloon's basket, right!? Ah! A reaction! This is clearly pollen from a yellow flower! We'll find out soon enough whether or not it's from the same flower!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
WH-WHAAAAAAAAT!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'd say this proves that... ...the body double's death was caused directly by your own hand!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
No way! That's...! That can't be! I...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You crushed the body double to death on the roof of the tower! Then, you retrieved the body and hid it in the warehouse.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Why... did he have to go to the trouble of retrieving the body?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Two nights ago, he knew, that a separate incident would occur at the tower.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! Ms. Crane's...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely. Leaving the body there would have disrupted his plans.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I see. But even so, he couldn't leave the body in the circus warehouse either.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly. So the next day, when he was bringing the body back to the tower once again... ...he saw the small fire John started, which caused the Moozilla's head to fall! Was that when the idea came to you? Your plan to pin the crime on John.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Gaaaaah...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
You made it look like the murder weapon was the fallen head. Such foul, cowardly behavior...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
For that reason, you carried the double's body in the balloon and lowered it into the film lot. At that time, the figure of the body double being lowered down by a rope... ...was captured in John's video recording!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
D-Damn... I-It was all... You saw through it all!? Damn it... DAMN YOUUU!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You manipulated animals, you manipulated people, and you manipulated cases... ...almost as if you were a king. However, it's now all come to an end...
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Simon. The animals have gotten angry. Even Money and Astique. You never thought of them as your friends at all... How sad.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
D-Damn it! Don't you look at me with those eyes!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. It's about time you went back to being a mere clown. A fitting end to your... pitiful jester's act.

U... Uwah... S-Stay away! Get away from meeeeeee! Stop it! Please stop it...!

Mr. Edgeworth. I must thank you. You have exposed the true identity of the <span style="color:#E16935">mastermind</span>. Now... I am free to...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
...Drawing a gun would be most inadvisable. Stay where you are and do not move.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Ngh... I-I don't have a gun...
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
You do have a gun, do you not? You intended to draw and fire it without anyone noticing.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He must have taken it from the body double when he killed him...)</span>
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
This man has betrayed his bond of trust with me. He would have me kill the president, while knowing full well he was the body double. Lying about a target is an extremely dangerous thing to do to an assassin. Not having all the cards on the table can seriously jeopardize an assassination.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Uuggghh!
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
However, what is even more unforgivable... ...is your deception and your attempt to manipulate me. The time has come... for your retribution.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Stop!
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Y-You are...!
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
It has been far too long, Shelly.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Please step aside. That man is my prey.
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
I must ask you to spare his life. Please permit this young acolyte to receive his proper punishment in prison.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
........
</p><p>Simon:<br />
........
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
And if I refuse?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
His is the first life I have ever saved... I will not allow it to be taken away so easily.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
You saved a life...? The assassin, Sirhan Dogen?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. Ironic, is it not? That I, the one who has taken countless lives, am making a plea for this young one's life. He saved my life, just as I have saved his. Before I knew it, I grew quite fond of the lad. You may laugh at me as much as you wish. However... I must ask that you spare the life of the boy. From one assassin to another... Please make this allowance.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
........ ...I understand. If you are willing to go that far...
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
You have my thanks. I am in your debt.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
......No need for thanks. I simply felt there would be no merit in a fight to the death with you. That is all. And with that, I must take my leave.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Damn it! Wait!
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I must thank you as well. It was necessary for this young acolyte to be put in his place. And that, you have done. ......Now then, it's time for me to return. To my humble cage, surrounded by iron bars. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?

</p><p>John:<br />
.....Ugh!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
J-John!
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Do not panic. I simply lent the boy with horns my knife. Take that knife... And run it through my throat! A single stab should do it. I've long grown weary of my wooden carvings. Keh heh heh.
</p><p>John:<br />
.......Revenge...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
J-John! Don't do it!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
John... Please, I beg of you!
</p><p>John:<br />
...Until just now, I had intended to seek revenge... no matter how many years it took.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Revenge...? Revenge is good, really good. ...All your pain and suffering slips away. Everything becomes numb, and you'll feel nothing.
</p><p>John:<br />
Yeah, you may be right. I thought about that while I listened to what you had to say.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...John!
</p><p>John:<br />
But, the only one who would be satisfied with revenge would be myself, right? If I became a murderer, my mom would go through even more pain and suffering. My friends from the movie too, and all those people who care about me as well...
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Keh heh heh. The boy with horns... says some interesting things.
</p><p>John:<br />
That's right. I finally get it now. I'll never forgive you, but... I'm not the one who should punish you. After all, isn't that what my mom... and that prosecutor guy are here for?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
John...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
John... you just said some really profound stuff just now!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kay, perhaps you should study up a little more yourself...)</span>
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
Is that so? ...Well then, young one. It is time for us to depart.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Wh-Where to?
</p><p>Dogen:<br />
To prison, of course. That place will be our home.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Our home...?

Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Why'd you call Uncle Ray and the rest of us out here?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..........
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth. The formal proceedings have just come to a close.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Hm? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is the place where I once relinquished my <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor's badge</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtney:<br />
! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
In order to save me when I was suffering from memory loss, you...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
......A certain man once said... ...the only ally a defendant has is their attorney. By trusting in their client, an attorney draws closer to the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>... The sight of that man still shines brilliantly in my eyes... ...just as the image of my father fighting in court does.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Gregory...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, this is nothing more than that man and my father's way of life. ......It is not mine.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I think I shall live as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span> after all.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
.........I see. So, you've made your decision.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm sorry...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
No, no, I understand... That's your answer, isn't it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It is.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
OK! Then that's the end of this conversation! Don't regret it. Even if you beg me later, I won't let you work for me ever again!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I-I understand.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
But you know, Miles... Mind if I ask why you chose to live as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.......... Mr. Shields. You asked me this before...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ray:<br />
To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I've thought long and hard about that question ever since. How should I live my life...? ...And after this case concluded, I finally found my answer. I want to save people as a prosecutor.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
As a prosecutor...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Simon Keyes... He, too, was a <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span>. He lost a parent in a past murder, and with it, the ability to believe in anything else. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I, too, know that feeling...

</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Keyes must have been all alone... Unable to find salvation from the law, he had no choice but to turn his hand to revenge.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I want to save those like Simon Keyes.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So, how would you save him?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm sure this tragedy could have been avoided if only he could have relied on the courts.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
But instead, he was cornered by Blaise Debeste, who used the power of law for evil. The form of the <span style="color:#E16935">law</span> can change depending on who wields it. It can be at once a shield to protect... and a blade to harm. That, too, is a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction of the law</span>...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
A contradiction, huh...

That's true... It sure is a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction in the law</span>. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The only way to right those contradictions is by joining in the court system... The one who could save Simon Keyes was not an attorney... ...but rather a watchman of the law: a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>. I shall face the contradictions in the law as a prosecutor.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
.......... I see. That's just like you. But you know... It'll be tough. It won't be just a walk in the park. You'll be going up against the <span style="color:#E16935">law</span> itself... You do realize that, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I do. However, someone must.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
.....Yup, yup. Uncle Ray believes in you too. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. I'm sure you can pull it off. After all, you're Gregory's son. Your old man would never give up, no matter what. His eyes always saw only what laid straight ahead. Miles... When you chose to live as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>, your eyes looked just like your father's. It looks like you've grown a bit. I really wish your old man could see you now...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Thank you very much, Mr. Shields.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Allow me to formally return this to you.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Please do.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I, Justine Courtney, as a member of the P.I.C, do hereby return to Miles Edgeworth... ...the rights and privileges of a prosecutor, in the name of the Goddess of Law...!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Prosecutor's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>

<p>Gumshoe:<br />
That's great, sir!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, it's time for Uncle Ray to make his exit. I have to report to your old man all about the traitor in the Edgeworth family.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Thank you for everything, truly.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
The next time we meet just might be in the courtroom. I hope you'll be ready. ...Uncle Ray might not look it, but he's an ace attorney, after all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'll look forward to seeing the attorney my father trained in action.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Take care!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth... Welcome back.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Judge Courtney. I must give my thanks to you as well.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
To me?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You sought to fix the corruption within the P.I.C. from the inside. That must truly have been a lonely battle.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
No, it was not... for I was never alone.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Because the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Law</span> is always by your side, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You made me realize that one could fight in such a way. The Prosecutor's Office, no, the entire legal world is caught up in this contradiction. If that cannot be set right, there is a <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> that will never see the light of day... It was only through your help that I was able to find this new path. One that fights against the <span style="color:#E16935">contradictions in the law</span>.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I, too, find that promising, as one in the service of the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Law</span>. You shall certainly succeed in helping the <span style="color:#E16935">law</span> grow.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let us meet again in the courtroom.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. I must apologize for my shameful acts during the trial two days ago... Next time, I shall fulfill my duties as a judge perfectly.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your Honor...... I do not intend to speak regarding your ideals.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, the <span style="color:#E16935">greatest judge</span> I know... ...is one overflowing with humanity. Even during a trial, that judge experiences happiness, anger, sadness, and joy... ...but nevertheless, always hands down the correct verdict in the end.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's difficult to say... ...but sometimes, I feel that... ...perfection is not always correct.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
So, a judge, too has the right to behave in such a manner... ...Thank you very much. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Law</span> was not the only one by my side.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! It's John!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. No matter how painful things became, no matter how strong the foe... ...when I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward. Wrongs must be put right. For John's sake, as well...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(John, too, lost his father in a past crime...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That is more important to me than even the words of the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Law</span>. Ha ha. Though I'm sure the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess</span> would be angered by those words.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I don't have to be perfect, I just want to grow little by little. Both as a judge, and as a mother. ...That is how I feel.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. It seems there is much each of us has yet to learn.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Agreed. We are still but children before the world. Let us grow in our respective paths, until we meet again. I shall look forward to that reunion... May the blessings of the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Law</span> be upon you as you follow your new path!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Though I once lost my position as <span style="color:#E16935">Prosecutor</span>, I have now reclaimed it... ...so that I may tread a new path as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>. I shall surely reach the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> waiting at the end of this path. No matter how difficult the path may be... ...if any seek to stop me on my path, they shall receive no mercy. No matter who they may be, I will shout just one word.

It seems... that the wound on my left arm has yet to heal. The bodyguard who inflicted this wound upon me... His is a name I will never forget. Now then...

</p>

<p>Elbird:<br />
I mighta been knocked out once by that prosecutor named Edgeworth... ...but I'll keep on trying to escape. I won't let him dampen my fighting spirit. Ain't that right, Rocky? The gong that'll sound off my next escape will ring out soon enough. Until then, let's keep working out.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sahwit:<br />
Are you inquiring into my studies to become a pet groomer? I am working as hard as ever. I spend every day covered in mud... Perhaps this suits my true nature far better than the life of a newspaper salesman. Once I leave the prison, I hope to earn an honest wage as a pet trimmer. ...Huh? My sentence has been extended? Because I was Warden Roland's accomplice? Oo... ooo... oooh. UOOOOOOOOH! Why do you think I've been giving a rat's ass about these stupid animals' well being!? To hell with the pet trimmer's license! Daaammiiiiiiiiit!

Regina was really shocked by the truth about Simon too... I mean, I trusted him as my subordinate... But there's no use fretting over it. The show must go on.

<p>Dogen:<br />
It seems I have grown soft in my old age. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? To think the life I saved on a whim 18 years ago would drive me to such lengths.

Monsieur Shields, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I am truly grateful to them. I cannot believe I am able to eat your desserts once more, Monsieur Master!
</p><p>Master:<br />
Ho ho... I have been allowed to distribute my treats in both the detention center and the prison. For the past 18 years, I have brought joy to one and all with my delicious sweets!

<p>Delicia:<br />
Yessie! Thanks for everything, boys! Of course... I owe Greggy my thanks too! After all, I get to stuff myself with Jeffy's delicious desserts once again! Oi! Next time, maybe I'll use one of Jeffy's sweets to create a new drug. "<span style="color:#E16935">The Tuck in Diet</span>"... You'll tuck in your stomach while you tuck into desserts!

Man! I'm glad I got to meet and sketch so many beauties! ...But, Mandy caught a glimpse of my beauties sketch. She had a misunderstanding, and clobbered me in the face with my sketchbook. So in exchange for my sketch of beauties, I had one beauty walk out on me. Maybe it's time for me to start getting more serious about my life. Do I take the path of an artist, or do I follow the path of my heart...? Oh, and by "heart" I mean the heart of my new lady!

<p>Ray:<br />
Mr. Badd. Thanks for all your help today.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Hmph... I'll testify about the IS-7 Incident as much as you need me to... ...Prosecutor Edgeworth... seems pretty active too.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He chose not to take the same path as Gregory, but rather, to live as a prosecutor. Well, I am kinda sad that I won't get to work with him, but I'll continue to watch over him.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Heh... It looks like you've grown up quite a bit yourself.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He he heh. I'm so happy. Mr. Badd actually praised me! If you ever need a hand from attorney Raymond Shields, give me a call, any time, any place!

<p>Karin:<br />
My crimes were punished far more leniently than I expected. Once it was proven that I had been threatened... Ouch! "No crime is more heavy or light than any other"...? I'm sorry. Of course I regret what I did. However... I'm so glad I can still be together with you, Granny. Huh? You want to hurry back to work? Ha ha. That's right. The next corpse is waiting for us, after all!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ema:<br />
I'm glad that my scientific investigation came in handy this time around as well. Good thing I rushed back here all the way from Europe! And now... I have to leave again. That kinda takes the fire out of a girl, as you can imagine. Aha ha... But, this is all so that I can become an actual forensic scientist! ...So then, I guess it's time to go. Ah. If anything comes up, be sure to call me right away! The second I get the word, I'll dash right over!
</p>

<p>Franziska:<br />
The greater the father, the greater the expectations are for their children. Prosecutor Debeste... was it? His way of life shall be tested henceforth... ...just as mine was. Miles Edgeworth chose to live a different life from his father, as a prosecutor. I suppose... That, too, is an answer.
</p>

<p>Lang:<br />
I could never have imagined... the truth that my old man was hiding. Unlike me, who only thought about the Lang clan... ...my old man was trying to protect an entire nation. But I swear to you all that I will carry on his will. Even if the president was a fake, and the real one was murdered... ...I swear that I, together with my men, shall revive Zheng Fa! Someday, I will surely show you all a Zheng Fa brimming with life.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Debeste:<br />
I've asked everyone to stop calling me "<span style="color:#E16935">The Best</span>". ...I don't like it. It makes me feel like I'm just borrowing Pops' power. I shall study even harder than before and triumph over Pops! I'll become strong enough so that I won't lose even to Mr. Edgeworth! Now then! Let's start by thinking up my new nickname!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Powers:<br />
A lot has happened, but thankfully, the film was a roaring success.
</p><p>Penny:<br />
The gossip articles about the murder made our movie the talk of the country. "<span style="color:#E16935">A Monstrous Man Appears from the Mighty Moozilla! This Is the True Face of the Monster Who Murdered the President of Zheng Fa!</span>" ...Huh? Isn't that you in the photo, Mr. Powers?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Huh!? How could something like this happen!?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Now, now, it's fine, isn't it? It's thanks to those articles that our film is a big hit.
</p><p>Powers:<br />
*sigh*... M-Much obliged.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtney:<br />
John. I greatly enjoyed watching your movie.
</p><p>John:<br />
...I-It's no big deal. It's not like I had a major role or anything.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
What are you saying!? You played the key character who connects Moozilla and Gourdy! There is no one else besides you who could have played the part!
</p><p>John:<br />
...Y-Yeah, I guess. Well, it would be nice if there's a sequel. I really enjoy working as an actor. ...Mom, before we head home, can we go buy something? I'd like to decorate our home with a Lion Lily, for dad.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Then, one will not suffice. You will need two more: one for me... and one for Amy.

Wow! We were really busy with all those cases, weren't we, sir!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed, we were. Why did all these incidents happen in such quick succession?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I feel like things are always busy whenever I'm around!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Wait, Kay, wouldn't that mean you're a magnet for crimes...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey! Gummy, that was rude.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I do get the impression that he's not entirely wrong...)</span> So then, Kay, do you intend to resume your training to become a Great Thief?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hmm. I dunno...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh? Is something on your mind, pal?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
How should I put it...? Until now, I've always been chasing after my father... ...so that I could become a Great Thief, just like him!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Like the previous <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</span>, I suppose...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But... watching you, Mr. Edgeworth, made me think. Maybe, instead of chasing after my father, I should find my own path. ...I mean, you didn't become a defense attorney either.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Chasing after a parent's shadow isn't the only path in life for a child, after all...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I'm going to aim to be a <span style="color:#E16935">hero</span> in my own way!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...That sounds good.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But of course, that doesn't mean I'm gonna throw away the name of the Great Thief Yatagarasu!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
No matter what sort of hero you become, Kay will always still be Kay!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Thanks, Gummy! And Gummy will always be Gummy!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Of course, pal. I plan to keep pushing forward on my path of a detective, after all! Mr. Edgeworth! I look forward to continuing to work with you, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. I'll be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe. Detective, you saved me many times during these past cases. ...You have my gratitude. I suggest you look forward to your next salary assessment.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Whaaaat!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
......D-Does that mean... what I think it means...!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What's wrong? I am saying that your salary ought to be raised.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
R-Really, sir!? I can't believe it!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Isn't that great, Gummy!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
It's like a dream come true! I can finally say goodbye to my instant noodle lifestyle!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, that doesn't mean you can start slacking off. The real work begins from here on out. ...You should prepare yourself.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yes, sir! Roger that! I'll devote my body and soul to following after you, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The path Mr. Shields and Judge Courtney taught me... ...is to take a stand against the <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction in the law</span>... ...and to reach the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> at the end of that road. <span style="color:#0070C0">(What am I able to do? That is a question I must continue to dwell upon. Certainly, this path will not be easy. However...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtney:<br />
...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Law</span> was not the only one by my side.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! It's John!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. When I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Bonds... huh.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ahh! I completely forgot!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Th-That was sudden. What's wrong?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I was searching for members for the new <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</span> team!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now that you mention it, I do remember you saying something to that effect...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But in the end, I wasn't even able to find a single person. Can you imagine it? A team, combining their powers, in order to steal the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>! I wanted to create an invincible team like that, but...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
What are you saying, pal!? Don't you already have a team!? Together, the three of us can solve any case that comes our way!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah! You're right! A prosecutor, a detective, and a Great Thief! We're the invincible trio of heroes that steals, captures, and pursues the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hearing all that kind of makes me feel sorry for the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
As long as the three of us are together, there's nothing to fear! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, you are correct...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Even until his last moments, my father ran along his own path. I, too, shall advance along mine... ...accompanied by my somewhat boisterous comrades. As long as they are by my side, I can walk forward without hesitation... ...on this new path as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>. <span style="color:#E16935">Prosecutors</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">attorneys</span>... The path I walk is not my father's. However, I am certain that the two paths are not separate. Though we may walk in opposite directions, our destination is the same. Why, you may ask...? Because both paths lead to the one and only <span style="color:#E16935">Truth</span>.
