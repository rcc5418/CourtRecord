<p>Two cards. One of the black raven... ...and one of the white raven. A country torn in two. One to the west... and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> will reveal itself.
</p><p>I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#0070C0">-- 8 Hours Earlier --</span></center>
<center><span style="color:green">March 14, 10:17 AM<br />High Prosecutors' Offices<br />Room 1202</span></center>
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.)</span> On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. <span style="color:#0070C0">(How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And suddenly, the phrase "the fragility of dreams" comes to mind...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What are you talking about, "fragile dreams"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your "fake".
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Say what?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
.........
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh, and that is?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Take a look at this!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret." That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
The date the card mentions is today!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Today, huh...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You mean Ms. Yew? <span style="color:#0070C0">(The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... <span style="color:#0070C0">(There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I knew you'd come around!

<p>Kay:<br />
Yeah! The climax was really awesome! "Steel Samurai Sushi Slice!" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. ..................
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?)</span> .........
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If that's the case, then why the "versus"...?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Also, both countries claim to own the real "Primidux Statue", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Perhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time.

Hey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits.

No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah, I did, but...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase.

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
*sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
He's...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A suspicious person?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud.

</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
I don't need to answer.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Bahahlese law... ...giving them exclusive <span style="color:#E16935">extraterritorial rights</span>.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Extraterristrial rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
*sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
N-No way, sir!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home.

By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And why are our police guarding an embassy?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Except for how mutally unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again.

Well, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident.

B-But that's... preposterous!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
.........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
These items... They're...!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I don't think I was in the way... *sniffle*
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required.

Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Well, well... It certainly looks that way.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Babahlese ink?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And that reason is...?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the deal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgement down upon with my Whip of Justice.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved.

He was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm sorry, but did you say "printing"?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Our country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before.

! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident.

The defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny.

So your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case...
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
It's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him.

It's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir?

Perhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose.

Speaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets!

</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-What...!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Definitive Evidence --</span></center>
<p>Shih-na:<br />
The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife.<br />
The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer is holding.<br />
I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim.<br />
The knife is part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other.<br />
The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
You see now that she is definitely the killer, right?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>???:<br />
...Who's there!?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Shih-na:<br />
This is...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Shih-na:<br />
I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone prints on it.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...!

Gnnrk! <span style="color:#0070C0">(She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!)</span>

I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the middle.

I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem.

I! That is...

<p>Shih-na:<br />
! Y-You can't be serious...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Aah!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Ack! After the fire had broken out...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer!

What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!?

...Your argument is still not airtight.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Would you care to elaborate?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
The fact that she calls the Yatagarasu. That in itself is a more elegant proof.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ms. Shih-na.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will talk it the best I can!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Wh--!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well, I guess we'd better get going!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Going...? To where?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt.

Hmph... Understood.

Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
How dare you make such assumptions!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma.

Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join in the investigation.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well.

My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Franziska! As your subordinate, I'm a part of your investigation now. Don't you think it would be beneficial if I was as well-informed as you?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
.........Point taken. Very well, I'll fill you in. Recently. we discovered some very well-made counterfeit bills circulating in Zheng Fa.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Counterfeit bills?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Yes... As you may have deduced... ...the counterfeits are being made with Babahl's special Babahlese ink. And it's virtually impossible to distinguish bills made with Babahlese ink from real ones. Thus, it was only natural for Interpol to keep an eye on the Republic of Babahl.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's where this document comes into play, correct?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Correct. Mr. Coachen was smuggling large amounts of Babahlese ink. Furthermore, he was charged with running the Embassy's printing equipment. That's all the evidence I need to know that he was the head of the smuggling ring. However, there remains one tiny problem.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let me guess. You still have yet to find the counterfeit bills or the smuggled ink?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Yes, and while we're listening things, I might as well add the counterfeit plates to the pile. Since we haven't been able to locate any of these items in the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're looking into the Allebahstian Embassy next. It doesn't matter where they're hidden, mark my words, I will find them.'

Mask☆DeMasque... I see that yet another weirdo has popped up in my absence.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, and as I understand it, he was a brilliant thief to whom the world was his oyster. He stole extremely valuable objects one after another for a while. Detective Gumshoe was in charge of the case, and not once did he catch DeMasque.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Hmph... I had already researched all that, you know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Last year, when DeMasque gave himself up and was finally arrested... ...he was apparently represented by that man. Knowing him, I'm almost curious as to how insane that trial turned out to be.

What exactly is that hideous, fashion faux pas of a costume he's wearing supposed to be? I feel like I've seen it somewhere before... ...but there's something different about it than what I remember.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That costume is from the very first Steel Samurai. It's a live-action superheroes show on television, beloved by children and adults alike. The Steel Samurai's weapon is the Samurai Spear. And it is with the Samurai Spear that he performs his special attacks... ...which enthrall all who watch them in action.

N-Not at all! And in any case, Franziska... ...I believe the Samurai you are familiar with is the second one... ...the Nickel Samurai, which was part of that case last year. Do you recall that case?

N-No, I'm not in shock over anything... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I wanted to forget that I had received the Steel Samurai autograph from Larry... But... the autograph...

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? No way! It's exactly as it should be, yo!

I have here the autograph you wrote for me earlier. Now, take a good look at this which you drew with your own hands. You can see that spear is clearly of a different shape!

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You unbelievable--! This is an EMBASSY!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
But I've always been like that... ever since I was a kid. One time on an overnight field trip, I bought a fake sword and played with it late that night. I'm just a useless, hot-blooded maaaaaaaaaaan!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Larry, clarify that for me, will you?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
OK, so it was some field trip, and I began to shadow-fight with myself...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Not that! I meant what you said earlier, about spinning the spear and hitting the wall!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Oh, that! It's no biggie. It's not like I left a hole or anything!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's not why I'm asking, Larry. The Samurai Spear is made of metal. I somehow doubt that a move as simple as spinning it around would cause it to bend.
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Man, Edgey, you're so naïve!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-What!? Where did that come from!?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Well, you keep calling it the Samurai Spear. But it's not real. You can't really fight someone with it... ...because it's hollow on the inside! You could hit it against practically anything and it would bend.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I-Is that so...?

...I thought they were for a while... because their M. O. and targets were different. DeMasque likes high-value trinkets and jewels, and being gaudy is his signature. Gumshoe was in charge of that investigation, so he'd know more about DeMasque.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That's alright. All I'd probably hear are tales of his failure anyway.

I was in the next room, you know, trying to get in some beauty sleep. But it was so noisy here that I couldn't fall asleep. So I came over to complain!

I really couldn't say no, so here I am, playing the role of the heroine! Instead of that Mindy girl, I mean. But the poor girl, I feel bad for her. Because they let me stand in for her, she's going to have a terrible time when she returns. I mean, I'm not exactly great at reading that strange font they use, plus I was called in to be a stand-in at the very last second, so I tripped over all the most important lines, I threw that rag doll instead of the shuriken, hit the Steel Samurai instead of the enemy, and the audience was in an uproar, but as an avant-garde actress, they'll forgive me, because I tell you, they're really just a bunch of simpletons.

"Wéndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight". Hmph! How absolutely revolting! I mean, you'd think he could get my name right. There's no accent in my name!

You'd bust that evil stalker-man for my sake, wouldn't you, Edgey-poo?

</p><p>Officer:<br />
Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Good work. You may leave now, Officer.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... This dog...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too.
</p><p>???:<br />
Woof! Woof!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go!
</p><p>Missile:<br />
Woof!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog?
</p><p>Missile:<br />
Grrraaaaaaarh!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh? And what do we have... here...?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. <span style="color:#0070C0">(A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...)</span>

Why are you getting all excited over holding on to a lady's undergarment!? Miles Edgeworth... you uncouth sea slug! If you know the owner of said undershirt, then hurry up and return it to her already!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You have it all wrong! This is evidence! And the owner of this piece of evidence was in the room next door. And yet, despite that, Missile found it in the fireplace of this room. This.. lady's undershirt...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Are you seriously claiming that it somehow passed through a solid brick wall?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Not quite. The fireplace in this room is connected to a chimney. The other fireplace in the other room is also connected to the same chimney... ...leading us to the possibility that the two fireplaces are connected to each other.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Perhaps a closer look at the back of the fireplace is in order.
</p>

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There is an X on the back wall of the fireplace. Let's see if I can't get a better look at it.)</span>

<p>Franziska:<br />
Wh-What in the--!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The wall separating this room's fireplace from the next room's fireplace... ...apparently turns. As I suspected, this fireplace does indeed connect this room to the neighboring room.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The neighboring room?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There appears to be... nothing particular about the next room. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But the fact that there is nothing special about the next room isn't what's important. It's the fact that <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Connected fireplaces - Ambassador Alba&#39;s office fireplace is connected to the neighboring room&#39;s fireplace.">there is a secret passageway through this room's fireplace</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Connected fireplaces - Ambassador Alba's office fireplace is connected to the neighboring room's fireplace.)</span></span>!)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
We now know that the fireplace connects the two rooms. But how exactly is that significant? You aren't going to suddenly name the old lady as DeMasque II's killer now, are you?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, she couldn't move at all because of her stiff hip... ...so she could not have been the one. Unfortunately, I believe... ...that this fireplace has nothing whatsoever to do with DeMasque II's murder.

I was in the next room, you know, trying to get in some beauty sleep. But it was so noisy here that I couldn't fall asleep. So I came over to complain!

You really don't change, do you? When will you learn how to take a joke? Anyway, that Samurai Dog wasn't mine. Those things are a present from the studio to the Embassy.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
A present...?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
The studio big-wigs basically told us to play delivery boys. We were supposed to hand the Dogs off to the embassy people and tell them "hi". I had to pile them all into the pushcart just to move them all! Those studio guys should've delivered those things by themselves! Right, Edgey!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, did you deliver the Samurai Dogs to the embassy staff as per your instructions?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Hey! Edgey! Don't just ignore me and my question! Aren't you going to stick up for me!?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
Ah, about that. See, after the show, I went to rest a spell in the dressing room. Because of my bad hip, you know. And there they were, the Samurai Dogs were just sitting on the dressing room floor.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I suppose you had to make preparations for distributing them after the show.
</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
Well, if by preparation, you mean sampling them as well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Excuse me?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
Oh, I tried one and thought they were actually quite good! Sorry, but I just had to find out. I know it was silly of me to think this, but... ...I figured that since they're for a kid's show, their taste was probably for kids, too. But they were so good that I couldn't stop. Before I went back to my room, I just had to help myself to half a dozen or so boxes! As I sat there by the roaring fire, warming them and eating them, I thought, "Ah, this is..."
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
............
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
............
</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
Hmph. What is it now? Oh! I know! I bet you want a box, too, don't you, my Edgey-poo? Well, who am I to say no to you. But I'll only give you one. The rest are all for me.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Samurai Dogs forced onto me.</span>

Looks like the lesson for today is that when the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess... ...take off their masks, they transform into a pair of annoying troublemakers.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, "I guess I'm stuck marrying you." What kind of way to propose is that!?

Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador.<br />
After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around.<br />

Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..................
</p><p>Lang:<br />
But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed "murder weapon"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!)</span>

<p>Lang:<br />
I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II.<br />
Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.<br />
It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead.<br />
Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you?

Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well.

Excuse me, but "glittering red and offering up scent of blood"...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Do I have to spell it out for you? I mean the sight and smell of blood, of course! And according to the tests, the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. The swords was made to only be used on stage, so it's not sharp. But it is pretty weighty. It's certainly heavy enough to beat someone to death with. Which leads me to suspect that the victim was beaten to death with the sword.

So the sword is covered in the victim's blood...?

Yeah, the lab results confirm that the blood on the sword matches the victim's. But the sword is as dull as a vanilla envelope. It's just a stage prop, after all.

<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Do you know what this is, Agent Lang?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
It's the next most effective weapon after the whip.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(I think the whip is in a slightly different category...)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real murder weapon?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The way it's bent...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special "Early Summer Rain Jab!" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
..................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, I know that much about your history.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Well, the Primidux Statue belonged to the founders of Cohdopia. ...At least, that's how the story goes. It was bequeathed unto the king of Cohdopia as a symbol of the country's wealth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So it was meant as a symbol of sovereignty, and the right to rule, I take it...?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Yes, that's right! Which is why both countries are so adamant about their claim. "We hold the real statue, therefore, we hold the right to rule" is the reasoning. It's pretty petty when you think about it though, I suppose.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But if Allebahst and Babahl were to re-establish relations... ...shouldn't that put an end to the squabbling over the statue?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
...I have no reason to believe so. The Primidux Statue is even more important now as a key to diplomacy.

Ambassador Palaeno, if you could please take a look at this for me.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
..................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Primidux Statue sitting in Allebahst right now actually belongs to Babahl.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
...So it would appear. I received a call from Ms. von Karma about this earlier.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then you will understand why I wish to inspect Babahl's Primidux Statue immediately... ...because the statue currently in your country's possession...
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Yes, well, I've already inspected it myself. And it is definitely Allebahst's statue. I know because... it's the real statue.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Then you're saying that Babahl's was a replica?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
I'm embarrassed to say it's true, even though I knew that someday it would be exposed. I received my orders from the leaders of Babahl... ...and I was to negotiate with Ambassador Alba at this event. I was to negotiate with him and fix the results of the evaluation tonight... ...to say that we could not determine which statue was the real one.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why are you telling me this?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Well, because you already figured it out. Our statue is just a hollow gold shell. Even if Babahl were to lose face, the re-unification of the country is what's important. I'm right in thinking that, aren't I? I'm not making a mistake, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If you don't know yourself, then I won't pretend to know either.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
I never thought that by being betrayed by my own secretary... ...the real symbol of wealth would be given to me. Isn't it simply ironic?

</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You mean the fake Yatagarasu!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What... is it?

We're to wrap up our bodyguard assignment at the end of today. Oddly enough, we received word from HQ to return home on an urgent matter. Heh, as if I can be so easily called away from this case after I've come this far. I swear that I'll find the truth, and drag it out screaming into the light.

You were working as Ambassador Alba's bodyguard at the time... ...so naturally, you witnessed when the Yatagarasu appeared, correct?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, I saw the thief alright. With my own two eyes. The Yatagarasu was always there, lurking in the shadows. But when the spotlights were turned on for Ambassador Alba's speech... ...a shadow appeared. That's when cries of, "It's the Yatagarasu!" rang out. The next second, the spotlight went out... ...and by the time we got the area lit again, the deft thief had vanished. When we investigated afterwards, we found that the reason the lights went out... ...was because someone had unplugged the extension plug for all the outdoor electronics. Whether it was someone doing it on purpose... ...or simply a guest who had tripped over it, we don't know. But one thing is for certain. The Yatagarasu was here!

Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu!

You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture.

Franziska, if you could take a look at this. Don't you find it to be a bit suspicious?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Not at all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.............................. Hmph... As I thought. For you see, I was merely testing you just now.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
We have no time to waste on your pompous talk, so get on with your explanation already!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nghhooooh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Gnrk... I guess Franziska just couldn't understand my point. I need to think this through again. Now, the Yatagarasu's shadow... There really is only one thing that can explain how it was cast, and it must be this!)</span>

<p>Franziska:<br />
It's... another statue?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Yatagrasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Made? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of "King Primidux and the Battlefield"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on "The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Franziska:<br />
............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used part of her shadow.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Only one part?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Why didn't you say that in the first place!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're right. I-I apologize...

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Franziska:<br />
It's...!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
An accomplice? But who...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!)</span>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating Yatagarasu?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So... what have you found out?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...I got a piece of evidence.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
May I see it...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Sure, but you might regret it...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, "I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!"... She gave me... an interesting picture.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A journalist...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yet again, we don't know that! <span style="color:#0070C0">(There are too many mysteries to be solved in this case.)</span> Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Uncle Badd.........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But this could be how that person escaped!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now then, Ambassador, I'd like to ask about your movements before the fire broke out.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Before the fire...? Which fire are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Which one? There was more than one tonight?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Huh? ...Oh, I see. I guess you didn't hear about it. We had <span style="color:#E16935">two fires</span> here at the Babahlese Embassy tonight. What a bother all of that was!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wait, but the only fire we know about is the one after the Jammin' Ninja's show!
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Ah, well, the first occurred at the start of the Jammin' Ninja's show. Luckily, only the fourth and fifth floors of out embassy caught in fire. Not wanting to cause a panic among the theatergoers, we decided to keep it internal.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then the fire after the Jammin' Ninja's show was the second one of the night?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Exactly.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So the fire I witnessed was the second one... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Come to think of it, didn't Detective Badd make reference to the first fire...?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-When was this photo taken?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose this means that the photo was taken just after the first fire was put out.)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Photo of Yatagarasu data updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So then, what was the extent of the damage in the second fire?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
The second fire was contained to this floor, the third floor. I think it was left over embers from the fire on the floors above it that caused it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's... how should I put this... a very bad stroke of luck...
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
My office on the fifth floor, Manny's office here... ...and Manny himself... all gone in the blink of an eye.

I feel so sorry for you, Mr. Palaeno...
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Oops, look at me going on and on. Now then, what was it you wanted to ask again?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We were discussing what your actions and whereabouts for today were. And, if you happened to know, what Mr. Coachen's actions and whereabouts were as well.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Yes, very well. Let's see, I've been quite busy all day from morning until now. First I woke up and then I brushed my teeth. After that, I had a roll for breakfast...

So what did Mr. Coachen and you do this morning?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Well, originally, we were supposed to meet and shake hands with the Jammin' Ninja. But Manny and I wanted to turn it into a photo op, so we were here tidying up his office.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You helped clean Mr. Coachen's office...? Why were you not cleaning your own?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Oh, I think I forgot to mention this, but my office is <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Renovations - The Babahlese Embassy is undergoing renovations from top to bottom.">currently undergoing renovations</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Renovations - The Babahlese Embassy is undergoing renovations from top to bottom.)</span></span>.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Oh, but the tidying didn't take much, really. We just burned some files we no longer needed and expired coupons in the fireplace.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I bet cleaning up the fireplace must've been a real pain though, huh?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Ah, about that... I kind of forgot to clean the ashes out. Ha ha ha... I guess I'm up a creek without Manny here to get angry at me.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
An ambassador like yourself has been on the receiving end of a secretary's anger?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Oh, he was very good at being very mad. Why, even just this morning, he got mad at me. I spilled some Babahlese ink onto the back wall when I was burning the files, you see... ...and he got mad at me, saying that I should treat the ink with more respect.

Now then, if you could tell me what you and Mr. Coachen did this afternoon...
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Well, Manny and I went down together to the Theatrum Neutralis. We had to be there for the start of the Steel Samurai stage show. After the show started, I went back to my office on the fifth floor alone.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So they were together until the start of the Steel Samurai show.)</span>
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
A little while later, after I had straightened myself up a bit, I returned to the theater... ...because I was to take part in the photo op on-stage at the end of the show.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(There WAS a commemorative photo op at the end...)</span>
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
It was a fantastic photo of the 3 of us -- Ambassador Alba, the Steel Samurai, and myself. After the photo shoot, I went back to my office on the fifth floor... ...to prepare for my handshake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...He seems to be rather overworked for an ambassador.)</span>
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
When I got to my office, that's when the first fire broke out and I escaped down the stairs. My office was completely destroyed, but thankfully, no one was hurt. I admit I ran away from the first fire as fast as my legs could carry me... ...but during the second one, I pitched in and helped the embassy staff put it out.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So you didn't see Mr. Coachen again after the start of the Steel Samurai show?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Yes, that's right. The next time I saw him, he was lying there, in an eternal sleep.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see......... Ambassador Palaeno, I thank you very much for your help.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance, Mr. Edgeworth. If there is anything else, please don't hesitate to ask, alright?

I wonder if you might tell me what you noticed about Mr. Coachen's bottle of ink?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Umm... I just thought of it right now, but... ...during the second fire, Manny was worried about his office, so he came rushing back to it. I called out to him, and when I received no reply, I used my spare key to open the door... ...but when I did, I was greeted by roaring <span style="color:#E16935">green flames</span>. The flames were so big that I wasn't able to see into the room at all.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The fire was green...? What was the cause...?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Well, whitcrystal oil burns green when it's lit, as you can see by this lantern.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... And Babahlese ink is made from the same oil, which means it would also burn green.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
You know... ...I, too, had thought it was Manny's ink that had caught on fire. So that's why I was surprised to find out there was still a bottle of ink left on his desk!

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I believe that you said you might have an idea as to why Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Actually, I fear it may be my fault. As I was telling you earlier... ...we were to determine which statue was the real one as a part of today's event.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But because of the Yatagarasu and the fire here, that got canceled, didn't it?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Ha ha ha... I'm actually relieved the rest of the event has been canceled. For you see, Babahl's statue... well, it's just a replica.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And did Mr. Coachen know that about Babahl's Primidux Statue?
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Of course he knew! That's why he was the only person I could consult with. We'd have to do something once our statue was revealed as a replica. As to be expected, I was very nervous today, as this would impact our country's authority.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, I understand.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Well, when I told Manny my concerns, he said, "Let me handle it. It'll be alright. I'll find a way to make sure you're the ambassador of the re-united Cohdopia." At the time, I thought he was just trying to cheer me up... ...but when I saw that note, I realized he was serious...

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Coachen... conducted a lot of business behind your back. I assume he did all that to ensure that you are the next Cohdopian ambassador.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
But... why was he trying so hard, I wonder? He was so much better at getting things done than I ever was or will be...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't know the answer to why he was trying so hard yet... ...but I suspect he had an ulterior motive in mind beyond just simple kindness.)</span>

Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a paetner you can trust.

Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well.
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted!
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation.

Yup, sure did! I also helped put out both fires, sir! But that first fire took me by surprise! I had a tough time escaping the fifth floor.

Wait! That's odd... We always warn our staff that in the case of a fire, it's dangerous to use the elevator.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Maybe someone rode it in a fit of panic?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective, did you see the "Yatagarasu" that came into the Babahlese Embassy at all?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I didn't personally... ...and the other staff members told me they never got a good look at the person, either, sir.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So no one was able to get a good look at this "Yatagarasu" that entered Babahl?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah. All they saw was a mysterious person wearing a long coat. But that's not enough to make a positive ID, you know?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Still, it was enough to make the people who received the calling card panic even more.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A person in a long coat... Sounds like the exact same person I saw...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Yatagarasu that appeared in Allebahst was proven to be just a fabrication, a shadow. In light of that fact, the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl is also suspect.

Eeeeek! I'll be sure to do that from now on, siiiiir! But you know, it was thanks to me being lost that I was able to come to Kay's rescue!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh? Is that a fact?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah! It was when I was lost and wandering around in the third floor hallways, sir! When I heard a scream, I headed towards it right away!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh! That's probably from when I found Mr. Coachen's body!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah. I thought it sounded like her, so I got real worried and ran as fast as I could!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And it was thanks to Gummy that Ms. Shih-na wasn't able to take me away! He covered for me until you got here, Mr. Edgeworth!

Oh? I see. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So he CAN be useful once in a blue moon.)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Still, it's too bad that Agent Shih-na got here before I did.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... I wonder where Agent Shih-na was before you found her here?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, just before I got to this room, <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Shih-na&#39;s location - She was in the room next to Mr. Coachen&#39;s office up until she tried to arrest Kay.">I saw her coming out of the room next door</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Shih-na's location - She was in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office up until she tried to arrest Kay.)</span></span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Shih-na mentioned something about chasing the Yatagarasu herself earlier.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, she apparently helped in putting out the first fire. Then during the second fire I heard she was busy chasing the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
She seems to be a very dedicated agent. You would do well to learn from her.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Why are you pointing at me when you say that, sir...?

Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off.

I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil.

Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!?

Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink.

Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames.

The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's not because someone cleaned them up, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well then, I don't know what happened.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used!

If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to "talk" with the person who was in the neighboring room.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir!

Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na.

<center><span style="color:red">Investigation Complete</span></center>
<p>Kay:<br />
It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us!

OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace well.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
R-Right now, sir!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test out hypothesis first, don't we?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Go on, Gummy! You can do it!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too!
</p><p>Palaeno:<br />
Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
OK, here I go, sir!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Nngh... Y-Yes, sir...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
"Show off"...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gumshoe:<br />
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
*cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Are you alright, Gummy...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And that is...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na!

Agent Lang...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Lang Zi says: "Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves."
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...)</span> And what does that mean?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
But we don't know where the play money was gone.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang, I...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
.........Yes.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang! A moment, if you

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! Hold it! Objection! Pal!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">DeMasque II's Note data updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
.........Yes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm not trying to "pick a fight" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It would appear that way.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... With pleasure. <span style="color:#0070C0">(For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.)</span> Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You mean the "suspicious person in a coat" that she saw?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving the case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
"Pretended"? And what do you mean by that!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'll get to that in a second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did. Kay, if you could please explain what the person you were chasing did for us...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</span>. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the <span style="color:#E16935">3rd floor</span>.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
...Who's there!?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...What do you mean, "Why do you suppose?" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Grr...rrrnoooooooooh!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, not quite yet.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out our tactics?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other <span style="color:#E16935">possible escape route besides the door</span>... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's <span style="color:#E16935">escape route</span>.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh!

Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now!

We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! As I thought.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
.........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Shih-na.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!)</span>
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Now then, what is it you'd like to ask?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy?
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Shih-na's Movements --</span></center>
<p>Shih-na:<br />
During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire.<br />
During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl.<br />
While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over.<br />
Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu.<br />
To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's "<span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</span>" even exists.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Shih-na:<br />
And that is all I have to say.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
.........Good.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
No, I moved alone.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct?
</p><p>Lang:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
............!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
............Grr!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
..........................................I'm sorry.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Heh heh... This promises to be interesting.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So you helped with the fire extinguishing effort?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
I was in charge of the police on the Babahlese side, so I helped them with their work.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Police doing the job of firemen... You really know how to work people.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
She sure does. That's because she's one awesome woman who knows how to manage.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I guess so! She's always bringing you a business card or a scroll at just the right time!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
To prepare everything before I'm ordered to... That is the definition of a secretary.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
She kinda seems more capable than Agent Lang, doesn't she?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
At the very least, she's certainly more capable than you, Detective.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Oogh... I kinda had a feeling you were going to say that.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Shih-na's more than just a capable secretary, you know. Shih-na, tell him what other things you're good at.

There is no proof that the suspicious person was really the Yatagarasu... ...because no one was able to get a good look at the person's face.

Hmm... By the way, how was your team's investigation?

In order to extinguish the fire, water was pumped into the third floor via the windows. So the majority of the investigators conducted their searches on other floors.

Agent Lang, I'm talking with Agent Shih-na right now... ...so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't interrupt us with superfluous comments!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Grr...rrr.........! Grrrrrrrrrnnnnngh!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Aww... You know, I feel kinda bad for him.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I understand his pain at watching one of his subordinates being accused... ...however, I cannot turn my eyes from the truth!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Lang... I'm alright. And as for you, I think you should be focusing your doubts on that girl rather than me.
</p><p>Kay:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...And why is that?

Are you throwing Kay's words into doubt again?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Well, she does claim to be the <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu</span>, right? And she did try to chase down the Yatagarasu, despite being just an average children.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. Actually, she came here with the goal of capturing the fake Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's right, which is why I would never lie about anything related to the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
And I suppose you have proof of that somewhere?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Not quite, but even without any, I have people who believe in me, and that's enough.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
...I see.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay's testimony is without flaw, but as for yours... Well, let's just say that I find your testimony to be a bit suspicious.

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well... Allebast isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Wha--!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
.........!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
............
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as "Agent Shih-na". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
............
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
.........Phwwh... Phwwwwh...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.........!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Shih-na...?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I remember this irritating laugh...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
.........It can't be... But it has to be...!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Shih-na... What's wrong with you...?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..."Funny", you say?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.........!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />

</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
...Oh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof!

I have also heard the reports.

</p><p>Kay:<br />
I guess that means we really don't need to check that area anymore, right, Mr. Edgeworth?

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
And just what are you hoping he'll find?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
And what did you find out by doing that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall "door". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh? So what are these things that you found?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Ummm... Some <span style="color:#E16935">make-up</span>, a <span style="color:#E16935">coat</span>, and a <span style="color:#E16935">pair of shoes</span>, sir.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't "suspicious items" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Aww...!
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now?

Lang!

Yes, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
............
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put on the fire.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And what about the dark substance around the hem of your coat?
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace!

Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace...

Wh...!? How...!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe.

Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is.

</p><p>Shih-na:<br />
You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again.

My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time.

</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The flame...!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame.

Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since.
</p><p>Shih-na:<br />

Shih-na! You're...!
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu!
</p><p>Yew:<br />
That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a façade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly!
</p><p>Yew:<br />
You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay! Don't!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father!

You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief!
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why it has three legs...?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Badd:<br />
There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, it can't be!

Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal.

And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't have leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
D-Detective Badd!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away...

Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you.

Why do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me?

.........?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Aha! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You had another?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You were going to take Little Thief away from me!?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious Kay.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it?

In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasent assignment.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
.........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Why? There is no "why". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And why did you do that?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na.
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet.
</p><p>Yew:<br />
What about them...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you.
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
.........No, I want to keep them.
</p><p>Yew:<br />
Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm...?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Yew:<br />
I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Mr. Prosecutor!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, Agent Lang?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...)</span> It's finally over, Kay.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...)</span>

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...?

Uncle Badd...

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Unfortunately, it isn't.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
These are... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the pages from my KG-8 case files</span> that the Yatagarasu stole from my office!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh? Wait? WHAT!?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced "not guilty"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Amano's conglomerate...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..................
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What? Then that means...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
"Shih-na" wasn't the only fake name she used! "Calisto Yew" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
She said it herself; "I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning."
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this "trump card" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
"Trump card"...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
This is... a "directives card"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would sent a "card" along with it... to the police.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So that's what those white cards are!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Trump Card data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Badd:<br />
And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
What is this, sir?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ..was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is...

Larry, prepare to be buried down under by this piece of evidence.
</p><p>Larry:<br />
.........You know, Edgey, you're actually a really good guy at heart. I can't believe you'd do such a great thing for Roxanna and I!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.........What are you going on about!?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
What are YOU going on about? I thought you just said... ...that you were going to berry us down under! So you're gonna chase her down with me in Australia and cover us in berries, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I said nothing of the sort! If you had been listening carefully, you would've noticed I said, "buried".
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Wait, what? Aren't they the same word? You say, "buried", I say, "berried". Tomeito, tomahto.
