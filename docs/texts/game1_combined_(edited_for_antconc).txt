Phoenix:
Yes... ( '    up  ?)
Edgeworth:
  being   case,   must inevitably arrive     single conclusion:     "victim"     video     fake... then   murder     evidence room   also fake!   other words,   security camera does   show   instant     murder.
Phoenix:
Uh... Th-   ... Well,   guess  '  right...

Phoenix:

Judge:
  "huh"     acceptable excuse,   wouldn'  need police.
Ema:

Judge:

Phoenix:
Made   up?   mean, provided bogus evidence?
Ema:
  Prosecutor'  Office wanted   guilty verdict   badly. Lana forged   evidence,   Mr. Edgeworth used  ...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth!?
Ema:
Yes.    '  sure    '  know anything    !   couldn'    known     being given false evidence. Even  ...  '  when   all started.   rumors   Mr. Edgeworth,   mean.  '  all   fault...     could   just testified properly, none         happened!
Phoenix:

Prosecutor trophy (appears after presenting Gant Team Picture)
Edgeworth:
  award originates     ancient Chinese tale.   Chinese,   word "contradiction"   written   two characters:   first means "halberd,"     second means "shield."     heard   story?
Phoenix:
 ?  , uh... sure. Everyone knows  ! Why  '    tell   though...   Ema'  sake.
Edgeworth:
Very well. Long ago     kingdom   Chu,       arms merchant. One day,   presented   king   two items.   first     halberd   claimed could slice through any shield or armor.   second     shield   claimed could withstand any weapon.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Wait   minute.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Those claims contradict each other!
Edgeworth:
Very perceptive.   then again,  '  heard   story before, right? Anyway,     mentioned,   very descriptions   these items discredit them both. When   king pointed   out,   merchant   left speechless.   thus,   Chinese word   "contradiction"   born.
Ema:
 ,   see!     "chipped shield"     "broken knife" symbolize...
Edgeworth:
Precisely  .   symbolize   merchant'  items.   ancient tale ends     merchant     loss   words,    '    our nature   pursue matters   their conclusion... even     results   something   ugly    .
Ema:
Wow. Thanks, Mr. Edgeworth!   learned something new today!
Phoenix:
 '  funny...    '   , then why     only given   shield?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Ballistic markings...
Phoenix:
  may recall   term.   came up     first trial, two days ago.
Judge:
Ballistic markings     fingerprints     weapon. All bullets fired     gun   marked     weapon'  unique pattern.   examining   markings,     tell which weapon fired   bullet.  '  quite accurate.
Phoenix:
    two bullets   our possession. One,   bullet removed   Gregory Edgeworth'  heart.   other, Mr. von Karma,     bullet buried     shoulder.   could analyze both bullets... Then,     markings matched...     know   both bullets     fired     same gun!   very same pistol...   other words,   murder weapon   killed Gregory Edgeworth!

Just then,   lights came back  .   elevator door opened before   eyes.   saw three people inside, all lying unconscious   oxygen deprivation. Much     surprise,   pistol lay     feet.   knew then...     destiny.     last moments, Gregory Edgeworth   still unconscious.   died, never knowing who   shot  .
