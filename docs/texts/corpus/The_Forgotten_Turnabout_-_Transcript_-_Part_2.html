A coincidence!? I never thought I'd hear you say that word, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No matter how improbable, if it fits with the facts, then we must accept it as the truth... Isn't that the same with science?

Aha! We should discuss science in detail some day, Mr. Edgeworth!

Black market dealings in the Grand Tower!! Guess I really hit the mother lode this time!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Were all the items in the auction pieces of evidence?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
There was some normal stuff too, like stolen art and the like.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I wouldn't consider stolen art to be normal.)</span>
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
But, I reckon the evidence was the star of the show here! These folks are law fanatics, tryin' to get their hands on the latest goods from the police.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
So that's what you wanted to get pictures of, Ms. Hart? Pretty much! They were meetin' right under this very storeroom. So I watched 'em from up here.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You said you were here since yesterday. Did you witness the entire event?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
It was a black market auction, after all. They followed a fairly detailed procedure. First, the participants entered the storeroom from the viewin' platform one at a time. When they got in, they each took one of those masks on the wall over there... Funny thing 'bout those masks... They're all equipped with voice changers. Itty bitty ones. That way they wouldn't be recognized. They wanted to protect their... "an anemone"?
</p><p>Ema:<br />
You mean... their "anonymity"?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Yeah, that's it! Their "anomnintany"!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why not just say "identity" and make things easier for all of us...?)</span>
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
After puttin' on the mask, they'd go down the lift, and the next feller would come right in. On the way back, it was the exact same thing, but in reverse. They'd come up one by one, return the mask, and head up outta the storeroom.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Wow, that's pretty thorough.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Masks data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm. How many participants were there?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
11 people altogether. <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Auction participants - Entered the storeroom from roof one at a time.

Did that lift stay down the entire time?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Naw, it came back up. But there's a tiny gap in the floor there. There's a bit of space between the floor and the lift platform, ya see. So I could see just about everything that was goin' on down there.

Didn't you say you heard something strange during the auction? If it stuck out to you so much, it must not have been a sound that you would normally hear. For example... the screams of a murder victim.

Ack...! H-How do you keep figurin' everything out so quick? Th-That's right. I stumbled upon a murder in the middle of my stakeout... But please, don't make me say anymore. This is the biggest scoop I've had in a while...!

The murder that she overheard... It's most likely the same incident we are currently investigating. This is bound to be crucial information.

Now then, it's time to come clean. Tell me everything that you know.

...I was watchin' the auction... Gatherin' info for my story.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
You didn't just watch, though. You got shocking photos too! Right?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Uugh... A little while after the auction started... ...someone won a bid, and the Conductor banged the gavel. Someone hollered, "We'll finish the deal upstairs", or somethin' like that. "That ain't good!" I thought to myself, as I hurried back to hide behind the statue.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Did you see whoever came up?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Not quite, but I reckon the feller that came up was the winner of the bid. I could smell the buttery aroma of big, fat wads of cash.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Buttery aroma...? I can't imagine that at all.)</span>
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
I reckon this room is where the bidders ponied up the dough for their purchases. The two of 'em talked for a while...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wait. There was a second person in the storeroom?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
You betcha. I reckon it was the Conductor. And then outta nowhere, one of them started screamin'!Almost scared my britches off. I rolled myself up into a ball and kept on layin' bow.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So you witnessed the murder!
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Well, I wouldn't say that I witnessed it, but I definitely heard it though.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Didn't you try to stop them?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Just stop right there. That ain't even funny. What's a dainty little thing like me gonna do?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Dainty?)</span>

</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Nothin' really. It just went on like normal. I guess those rich folks didn't give a hoot. They got some nerve.

Of course. They'd pass through this storeroom on the way back from the auction... Ah!

Exactly.

</p><p>Ema:<br />
Let's start by examining that ladder over there! Based on Ms. Hart's picture... ...the person in the red raincoat headed towards that ladder. Chances are, something will turn up if we check there! Just touch anything you want to examine! If you do that, you'll be able to spray the luminol reagent at it! If there's a bloodstain on the spot where you sprayed, you'll get a reaction like this. Even so... Ugh. No matter how many times I see bloodstains, they're always so gruesome... There's a blood reaction here, but it's kind of faint. Let's spray it with luminol two or three more times, so it'll be nice and clear! You can see it clearly now. Ugh... It looks even more gruesome than before. Do you understand how to look for bloodstains now? There are probably a few more bloodstains here, so why don't you give it a try, Mr. Edgeworth?

When I first came down here, that box caught my eye too. It was just the right side and woulda made the perfect hidin' place! That's what I thought, anyway...

A chain wrapped around it? That's a bit strange... Right now, it doesn't seem to be locked up at all...

Do you have anything to confirm that the letter was actually sent by Kay?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Are you proposing that it was forged by the real criminal? That possibility was dismissed some time ago. There were no traces of forgery on the letter. Of course, there were no other traces besides Kay Faraday and the victim found on the letter.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Are you saying you found Kay's fingerprints on the letter?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The only fingerprints we found belonged to the victim.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
In other words... you can't really say that Kay is the culprit.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Didn't I just say that the possibility of a forgery has been dismissed? That letter was originally sent by Kay Faraday. Therefore, it is only natural to assume that she is the culprit.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
If memory serves me correctly... ...the blood in the meeting room was found in front of the statue of Lady Justice, was it not?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
To murder someone before Lady Justice... This culprit knows no fear.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I wonder about that. Have a look at this piece of evidence. Blood was found in the storeroom right above the meeting room. As you can see, there are signs that it has dripped down onto the floor below. And right under the hidden lift is...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The statue of Lady Justice...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then you understand. The murder did not take place here. The killer murdered the victim in the storeroom, and then moved the body to this room. What Lady Justice witnessed was a coward trying to conceal their crime! And not the moment of the murder!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />

Just how is Mr. Edgeworth naïve!? YEOOOOOOWCH!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Have you forgotten? Or are you just playing the foolish fool? The amount of blood in the meeting room is clearly greater than in the storeroom.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Uugh... Please don't just hit me and then ignore me... YEAAAARGH!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Such a large amount of blood couldn't have simply dripped from the floor above. And even if it had, there should have been much more blood left behind in the storeroom! The murder could not have occurred anywhere other than this meeting room!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Hmph. You're as predictable as always, Franziska.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Wh-What...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The difference in the amount of blood is just as you say. The question is, why does such a difference exist?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That issue is trivial. I've already explained it with my perfect logic.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, how do you explain the blood that was found in the storeroom? I don't suppose you're going to tell me that it somehow sprayed all the way up there?

But that's so weird! She was attacked in the storeroom, but there was less blood found there than... GYAAAUUGH!

Do you know when you lose the most blood after getting stabbed with a sharp object?
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Ah! I know! It's when the sharp object is pulled out, right!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely. After being stabbed with the candelabra, the body was moved to the meeting room. And then, the murder weapon was pulled out right here in this very room... That would account for the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind!
</p><p>Ema:<br />
But why would the culprit go through all that trouble?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Most likely to give the impression that the murder occurred in the meeting room. It seems Ms. Crane's keycard was used last night... ...but based on the time of use, it must have been a ploy by the culprit to mislead us. In all likelihood, it was the culprit who used the keycard to enter the meeting room.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Why would culprit have needed to do that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Perhaps they feared that the storeroom would be found out during the investigation? If they were involved in the auction, they would not have wanted it to become public.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Meeting Room Blood data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>

The auction... you say?

Perhaps you should go upstairs and see for yourself what items are on display. I'm sure that will allow you to understand what occurred here.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
........ ...Impressive, Miles Edgeworth. You're willing to go that far to protect her?

There's something big lurking behind the scenes of this case. Kay simply got caught up in it.

You're exaggerating.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Am I now? More than anyone, I would think you'd understand the significance behind all this. Why would you, a prosecutor working with Interpol, be involved in a domestic case? Wasn't your objective to crush a certain international smuggling ring? If your search for smuggled goods has led you here... ...then, isn't this feeling I have related to the case?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...I'm relieved. You haven't lost your touch, even though you've turned in your badge. I've heard about your situation... from Scruffy over there.

From Ms. Hart's testimony, we obtained a description of what the Conductor was wearing. And it matches what the victim, Jill Crane, was wearing.

I don't know where she was hiding, but... ...since you've seen it, you must know as well. There are numerous hiding places in that storeroom.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So the culprit was hiding while they waited for the victim to arrive...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended. After all, the victim was the organizer of the auction, the Conductor. During the auction, the organizer would have to be in front of the customers the entire time.

The candelabra in the storeroom? How do you know that?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
If the murder weapon had been prepared in advance... ...the victim's chest would have been stabbed with something completely different. Based on the culprit's auctions, it's clear where the murder weapon came from.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
There were signs suggesting that the candelabra was once placed in the storeroom, too.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The items in the storeroom were intended to be sold as goods in the auction. Although, where the murder weapon was procured from is not the main issue here.

Franziska, calm down and listen. Ms. Hart witnessed a part of the murder. The main point here is that after witnessing the murder, she says the auction continued...
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
That's right! Sure as can be! They all just kept goin' on shamelessly!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Do you think the auction could have continued without someone conducting it? If the victim was not the Conductor, the person killed must have been... a customer!

Nooooooooooo!

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
As I said from the beginning, Kay is not the culprit. After all, she herself was attacked by someone and lost consciousness. In which case, that would also make her a victim.

If the auction continued after the incident occurred...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. And the victim was not the Conductor, but a customer...

Everyone! Restrain the suspect at once.

Please wait! Kay Faraday is not the cul-
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Silence!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
This is quite troubling, Edgeworth. Didn't I tell you earlier? The P.I.C. desires a swift resolution to this case. If it's not, we could lose our trust with the public. They'd call us the Waste of Time Committee. Y'know, it's troubling for me as well, that sort of thing... And at my age too... *sniff* *sniff*
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
And on top of that... an illegal investigation is not something that I can overlook. Have you forgotten? You are no longer a prosecutor. You have lost all your authority. Furthermore... you have aided a criminal in evading the law.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Yes, yes. That's right. You're so reliable, Courtney.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I am aware of the consequences of my actions. You may punish me as you wish. However... ...we have found a new suspect. It's the person pictured here. Kay Faraday was attacked by this person and...

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
There is no need for your explanation. Just recently, a red raincoat was discovered in the vicinity of this building. The victim's blood and cherry blossom petals were found on the hood.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Cherry blossom petals? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Now that you mention it, on the viewing platform...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. They probably stuck on due to the blood. They were littered around the bloodstain.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
And we've received the forensic report on the blood, y'know. There's no doubt about it. The person in that photo is the victim, Jill Crane.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-What did you saaaaaaay!?
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Red Raincoat data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I-Impossible! That would completely destroy the foundations of our logic. We had believed the person in the red raincoat was the culprit. And now it turns out... that person is actually the murder victim. W-Wait. If that's the case, then the prime suspect would be...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ms. Faraday. You met a person in a red raincoat on the rooftop, did you not?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yes. I did, but...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The person in the red raincoat was the murder victim. And Kay Faraday came into contact with that person. Since one of the parties is now dead, what happened next should be clear...

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
There is no evidence she was attacked, is there? Furthermore, we must consider the possibility that the victim fought back.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's far too early to come to that conclusion! Kay is not the criminal!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
......You're wrong.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
K-Kay?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's... wrong. Even though I don't want to believe it myself... After hearing about the raincoat, I finally remembered. I only remember a little, but... from what I saw that night... ...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That can't be right!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then, why? Why do I have that memory? That person collapsed before my eyes... engulfed in a pool of blood... Why didn't I do anything? It must have been... because I killed her...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
It is clear to me, the validity of Kay Faraday's memory.

I beg to differ! ...That's right. Y'see... He's no longer a prosecutor, sadly enough.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Your actions have gone too far this time. An illegal investigation, and assisting in the escape of a criminal... I cannot even think of you as a former prosecutor! Now, humbly accept your punishment!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh...!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Oh, yes, that's right. I believe the plan of today was to hold your hearing before the P.I.C. Why don't we leave the hearing for tomorrow. Even though the result is already crystal clear. You should think long and hard about what you've done. ...Very long and very hard.

Heh... Perhaps my younger self would not have done something so reckless. ...The me from before had power. That's why I thought justice was on my side. Just like you right now...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.....
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, because of a certain man, my self-centered sense of justice was broken down. Ever since then... I began to see people in a different sight. I'm able to serve as a prosecutor only because of the support of the people around me. People like Detective Gumshoe, and all the other investigators. And... Kay, as well. Honestly, even I'm surprised at how much I have changed...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I see... Is that how it is? I've come to understand you a little more.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Understand me? Not likely. Someone like you, who forces her own sense of justice onto others could never understand.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I wonder about that. Is that what you think?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
If I could say one thing... ...it would be that this conversation has been very interesting. ...That is all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..........
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Our conversation is coming to an end, however... I have one last thing to tell you. The date of your hearing has been set. I came here today to inform you. Today. In the P.I.C. meeting room. May you humbly accept your fate.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...If that's all you wanted to say, couldn't you have just sent a messenger?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The holy words of the Goddess of Law simply cannot be entrusted to others. With that, Mr. Edgeworth, I bid you farewell. I shall be seeing you again later.

...Good, very good. That face. That expression! You were such a desperate one, y'see. That's why I really wanted to bully you, y'know? Y'see, even if you know the truth, there is simply nothing you can do. And that's the real value of truth. So shocking that it's to die for, y'know?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why don't you pursue the true culprit!? How much of the truth do you know!?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
...Do you understand now? The truth that you believe in is worthless, y'see. ...Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you? Powerless "former" prosecutor?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You...!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Ooh, scary, scary. Y'know, I guess the friends of a heinous criminal are also quite heinous themselves.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Blaise! Yoooouuuuuuu!

</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">April 6, 8:30 AM<br />Grand Tower<br />P.I.C. Meeting Room</span></center>
<p>Blaise:<br />
Ten members are present. The quorum has been met... From here on out, let the council begin! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A clear conscience... Don't make me laugh.)</span>
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Courtney, please give us your report.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
On April 5th, Prosecutor Edgeworth carried out an illegal investigation and resisted arrest. He was arrested by two of our members who caught him in the act: myself and Blaise Debeste. Prosecutor Edgeworth disrupted the investigation of Attorney Jill Crane's murder. He claims that the culprit, Kay Faraday, was arrested without sufficient evidence. Even now, his claim remains unchanged.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Tell us more... about the murder incident.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
On April 5th, the victim's body was found here, in the P.I.C. meeting room. Regarding the details...
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
I, Sebastian Debeste, the best prosecutor, will enlighten you!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The prosecutor in charge, Sebastian Debeste, will explain the rest of the details.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
The murder happened on the night of April 4th. The victim was one Jill Crane. On the same night, a black market auction was being held in this very meeting room. I guess Ms. Crane was taking part in the auction. Yup.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The murder occurred in the middle of the auction, did it not?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
When Ms. Crane was found, she was dressed like the Conductor of the auction. However, based on the fact that the auction continued after the murder occurred... ...I deduced that Ms. Crane could not have been the Conductor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You weren't the one who made that deduction...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Sebastian, please show everyone the basis for the arrest of the culprit.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
You got it, Justine. Kay Faraday was unable to bear the weight of her good conscience......
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I believe you mean her "guilty" conscience.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Yes. It was her guilty conscience that drove her to confess the crime. According to her confession, on the roof of this building... ...she met a figure in a red raincoat on the viewing platform.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
So Crane was wearing a red raincoat?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes, that's correct. The culprit used the Conductor's clothes as a red herring to mislead us... At the time of the murder, Ms. Crane was wearing a red raincoat.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
It was I who discovered the raincoat near this building!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He did? I'm sure it was the forensics team who found it...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
To be more precise, it was the forensics team under Sebastian's orders who discovered it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I thought as much!)</span>
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
According to the blood analysis... ...the person in the red raincoat and Ms. Crane were the same person! The decisive evidence is the culprit's own confession. She testified that she killed her! That's right, the culprit is Kay Faraday! It couldn't have been anyone else but her!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Well then, Edgeworth. If you have any objections, let's hear them.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.....I have no objections.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
I see, I see. It seems all the fight's gone out of you after your little overnight stay...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I will testify that Sebastian's investigation was fair and just.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha! Of course it was, Justine! Don't you know that I'm the fairest of them all!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Edgeworth, my boy. Despite how things may seem, I actually kinda like you. If...! And this is just an "if", y'see. If you were to withdraw your objection... ...you might be sitting on this side of the bench tomorrow.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.........
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
I'll ask you one more time, Edgeworth. Do you have any objections?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Don't take me for a fool.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I'd advise you to watch what you say!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This man is the one who should watch what he's saying! I'm talking about the case! Not about a chair! I demand a testimony! By all means, let me hear that! I want to know how the P.I.C. understands this case!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
A testimony from us, eh? Fine then. If that's what it takes to make you happy. Courtney, give him the materials from the investigation.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Sir? But, that's...
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
It's the end of the line for him. I'll let him go out in a blaze of glory.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...If you insist, Mr. Chairman.

</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Why don't we have... Courtney give the testimony?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I have no objections.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
M-Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't worry, Kay. You just watch from over there.

<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Summary of the Case --</span></center>
<p>Courtney:<br />
Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.<br />
The red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...<br />
We believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.<br />
The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.<br />
Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.<br />
That was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The red raincoat was up for auction...? Is that a fact?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
It is quite likely. The red raincoat had been a piece of evidence... ...in the assassination attempt on the President of Zheng Fa, as you well know. Originally, it should have been stored in an appropriate place... But when I asked about it... I learned that it went missing.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And it somehow made its way to the black market auction... Certainly, a natural conclusion.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
My, my. Well done, Courtney. Your explanation is as clear as ever.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I am much obliged. Prosecutor Edgeworth, will you concede defeat now?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. Sorry, but I don't plan on it.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I see... I am relieved.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Relieved? What does she mean? Come to think of it... Her reason for questioning me yesterday remains a mystery. Just what is she thinking?)</span>

So you're saying that a member of the P.I.C. was involved in illicit dealings?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Regarding that... I... I have no response.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
He's right, y'know. After this hearing is over, we're going to have to clean up our act.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
A splendid decision, Mr. Chairman!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Now, now. It is only natural, y'see. There's no need to flatter me, y'know? But, y'know, that has nothing to do with you at all, Edgeworth. Because by then, you won't even be a prosecutor anymore, y'see? Well, now that this tearful business has been cleared up...

Yes, sir. I will continue.

So, the red raincoat was also up for auction?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. It had belonged to Shelly de Killer.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why would the victim immediately leave her seat?

That had to do with how the auction was conducted. It seems that after the winning bid, the winner was required to pay for the item immediately.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(That matches up with Ms. Hart's testimony.)</span>

Prosecutor Edgeworth, I cannot understand your argument if you do not say it out loud. If you had simply asked, I would have been more than willing to explain.

That is impossible! Enough of your excuses!

Was the voice that Ms. Hart heard really that of Ms. Crane?

Such a shady conversation must've had somethin' to do with the case!

What did her voice sound like?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
H-Her voice? Well... it beats me. How was I suppos'd to know!? They were both usin' voice changers.

Yes. The voices Ms. Hart heard had been altered by a device. We must therefore question whether or not they have any bearing on this case.

No, no. Courtney is quite amazing, y'see.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You claim that the sounds Ms. Hart heard no bearing on this case? Even if they do not, it doesn't change the fact that the crime took place in the storeroom. At the very least, the crime must have occurred before the victim went up to the rooftop.

Well... Ms. Hart's testimony certainly made it sound that way...

Precisely. It was because she saw that the person's hand... was covered in blood. Anyone who heard her testimony would have arrived at the same conclusion. The person in the red raincoat was the culprit... and the blood on their hand was the victim's. However, if the person in the red raincoat was the victim, then the situation changes completely.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom. Immediately afterward, the victim was seen with blood on her hand. That must mean... ...the victim was still alive even after she was attacked. The blood on her hand must have come from her own wound.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
No way! Are you saying that she died from a hand injury?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, that is not the case. I suspect she just held her hand against the wound. It can't be seen in the photo, but at this moment, she must have already suffered a fatal wound.

Hoh, hoh. If that's true, then it changes a lot of things, y'know?

It seems you understand. This refutes the allegations against Kay. Kay encountered the victim after this picture was taken... I believe at that point in time, the victim was already on the verge of death. It's likely Kay just happened to be present when the victim reached the end of her strength.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Judge Courtney, were there any other bloodstains besides the ones on the hood?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
None... were detected.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't you think it's strange? The victim died from a stab wound to the chest. In that case, there should have been bloodstains on the front of the raincoat. However... the only blood they found was on the hood! This is a huge contradiction! The wound on the victim's head is no ordinary wound. After all, the victim sustained this wound before she was stabbed in the chest.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...It does appear that way, doesn't it? The victim first suffered the head wound. If she had already been stabbed in the chest, the raincoat would have been stained with blood... Therefore, it is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she stuffed the head wound. So the order of the wounds would be: first the head, followed by the chest. However, does that really change the situation?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
With this, a contradiction is born. One that overturns all of our assumptions up until now...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Is the change really that great? I look forward to hearing it. Well then, this contradiction, why don't you show it to me? With evidence!

Prosecutor Edgeworth. There was no contradiction after all, was there?

On the contrary, Judge Courtney. If the victim sustained her head wound before she was stabbed in the chest... ...a huge contradiction arises.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young. According to this... ...the head wound was postmortem.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
But that's not what the raincoat shows...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly, it's the exact opposite.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Bailiff! Hurry and summon Dr. Bonnie Young at once!  Until we hear what she has to say, we cannot close the curtains on this case!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Officer:<br />
Yes, ma'am! Understood!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Dr. Young is a busy person. It will take some time for her to arrive. In the meantime... let us try viewing this case from another angle. There's something that's been on my mind. One of the key figures in this case... The "Conductor". We still don't know who that person is.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Now that you mention it! Even after our investigation, we still have no idea who it is.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The Conductor has come up time and time again during this hearing. However, at this point in time, their identity remains a mystery. How about it? Do you have any ideas?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm still not sure at the moment. However... ...there is someone I have in mind. A certain individual involved with this case, who might know something about it.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Who's that...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Blaise Debeste! I demand your testimony!
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
........
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Don't say such a stupid thing! Why would you suspect pops!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Are you trying to cast suspicion towards the Chairman of the P.I.C.? Do you understand... what that means?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Status and prestige mean nothing before the truth. That man is trying to pin the crime on Kay! The evidence that was in Kay's possession: the ticket stub, the mask, the corsage... These items did not come into her possession out of her own volition. By some method, that man purposely planted them on her personage.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
........ It is hard to believe such a sudden accusation... but I'll ask just in case. Why... would he do that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Obviously, to direct suspicion towards Kay. I succeeded in drawing out those words from him earlier.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Mr. Chairman, your response?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
.........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Are you too shocked to speak?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
.....And what of it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said, "What of it?" You say that you drew out some words from me, but you don't have a shred of proof, y'know? No one else heard it but you. It just doesn't work like that, y'see. Or do you have something else? Y'know, some kind of basis for your argument?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This confidence... He also showed it at the cell...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I would like you to explain once more. I trust we have your permission, Mr. Chairman.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
But of course. I'm pretty interested in this matter myself, y'know. I'd like to know just what part of me semes criminal to Edgeworth. There's no one as honest as I am, y'see.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How can he say that with a straight face...?)</span> Let's start from the top... The fact that the auction was held in this room is a cause for suspicion. This is the P.I.C. meeting room. I imagine it would be difficult for non-members to enter.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
That's why... all the members have keycards, you know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I think we can assume that multiple auctions have been held here before. Therefore, suspecting a member of the P.I.C. would be...
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
...Debeste!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Y-Yes. Because the Conductor had to have been a P.I.C. member.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Wait! Nooooooooooo!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wha... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What was that all about!?)</span>
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Wh-What do I do, pops? I just helped the enemy!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha. Sebastian really is an idiot, y'know. But y'see, Edgeworth, I'm not the only one with access, y'know?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Indeed... There are eleven members in the P.I.C. Even if we rule out the victim, Ms. Crane... there are still ten potential suspects.
</p><p>It's not me!
</p><p>B-B-B-But, it couldn't be the Ch-Ch-Ch-Chairman, right?
</p><p>I don't know who it is, but whoever it is should just come forward!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Yes, yes. Everyone, just calm down, y'know? Edgeworth, is that all you got? Where's the evidence to suspect me?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
......
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Oh? So you've fallen silent. But you've gone too far, y'see. I won't forgive you anymore. It's too late for regrets, y'know? I'm a very important man, y'see. Former Chief Prosecutor and Chairman of the P.I.C.!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

There's no clear evidence to prove that you're the culprit, besides your own confession. Remember what I said? You must believe in yourself. Or perhaps... you cannot trust my words?

I see now..... I thought it was strange. The reason you were acting like you wanted to be found guilty... ...was because you were concerned about me... That is just like you, Kay.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's because... you're a good person, Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unfortunately... I may fall short of your expectations. I am not trying to be a good person. No matter how much you may want me to give up... I'll keep trying to save you. That is the nature of who I am. Whether or not it is a burden for you is none of my concern.

Her memories are vague? That would be bad for us as well. Didn't you say this earlier yourself, Mr. Chairman? Since we have the suspect's confession, we don't need to worry about the trivial details.

I do not think so. It is hard to believe that all of this is simply a coincidence. The voices on the stuffed animal were most likely recorded during the incident.

One of these voices must belong to the true culprit. From what we've heard, it must have been the one who was doing most of the talking.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
But what's the point? In the end, we still can't tell their gender or identity, you know?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed, because they had been using voice changers. It can't be helped.

According to Ms. Hart's testimony, just before the incident... ...two people came up from the auction hall, using the lift. It must have been the Conductor and one of the auction guests.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room. In doing so, we were led to believe the meeting room had been the scene of the crime. It was a ruse by true culprit. To hide the blood that had fallen from the storeroom!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
So we wouldn't find out about the existence of the black market auction... Correct?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. If the culprit had been unrelated to the auction, there would have been no need to do such a thing. Ergo, the culprit could have only been the Conductor!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Well then... Do you have any idea as to who the Conductor might possibly be?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The auction hall is at the <span style="color:#E16935">P.I.C. meeting room</span>, and furthermore, there is a <span style="color:#E16935">storeroom</span> above it. The Conductor must have been, at the very least, a member of the P.I.C.!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
So..... ...in other words, you suspect me, I take it?

Isn't it natural to suspect you, the one with the most authority in the P.I.C.?

Y'all sayin' the culprit was the Conductor, right? That means, the <span style="color:#E16935">victim was a customer</span>. Now, here's where it gets a mite strange. Ya see, there were <span style="color:#E16935">11 people</span> at the auction. When the auction continued after the incident... ...I went straight on over and snuck a peek down below.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Y-You don't mean.....
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
That's exactly what I mean. All <span style="color:#E16935">11 people</span> were still there, present 'n acocunted for.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-aaaaaaaaaaaat!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Are you sure about that?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Sure I'm sure. I saw it with my own two eyes.

Umm... so it <span style="color:#E16935">started with 11 people</span>. And there were still <span style="color:#E16935">11 people after the murder</span>... Was it a ghost!?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Y'know, Sebastian. Normally, a prosecutor would call that a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span>, y'know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
W-Were there really no changes in the auction at all?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Really! I'm tellin' ya! The auction just went on like normal. Ah. But... there was one itty bitty thing, though.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What was it?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Ya know those <span style="color:#E16935">hammers</span> ya always see at an auction? Like the one that lady is usin' over there.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...An <span style="color:#E16935">auction gavel</span>... perhaps?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Yup, that's the one! All of a sudden, I couldn't hear the sound no more. It'd been bangin' away just prior to it.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
She hid inside this costume drunk.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
A costume trunk... eh?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Ah! Now that ya mention it, that box was already there before I snuck in! I figure I would hide in there myself, but it was wrapped up nice 'n' tight with a chain. And it was locked too, so I had to give it up.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suspect that when you sneaked into the room, Ms. Jenson was already inside the trunk.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Yes... it would've been bad if one of the guests from the auction had opened the bid. After instructing me to hide inside... ...the Conductor wrapped a chain around the costume trunk. I think they went downstairs using the lift shortly thereafter. It was right before the auction...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So then, when the auction began... ...only you and Ms. Hart were in the storeroom.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Yes, that should be right...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The auction had been going on as usual, but... ...when a certain participant made the winning bid, the Conductor committed the crime. Ms. Hart must have heard the altercation that occurred then.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
You betcha! I was tremblin' behind that there statue the whole time though!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Following the altercation, Jill Crane was murdered. After killing Jill Crane, the Conductor carried her body to the costume trunk... ...and Ms. Jenson, who had been hiding in the trunk, was made to take Ms. Crane's place. The victim's body was placed inside the costume trunk. The Conductor then took Ms. Jenson, who had been made to look like Jill Crane... ...and returned to the auction hall as if nothing had happened. Was this roughly what happened in the storeroom during the incident?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Yes... That's right.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Pullin' the old switcheroo with one of the auction guests... Ain't that impossible? That gal and the murder victim are two completely different people, ya know. Don't ya reckon one of the other participants would've noticed and caused a ruckus?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, not at all. The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
From what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique. Furthermore, there was a rule requiring a mask to be worn during the auction. If their clothes were the same, I doubt anyone would've noticed she was a different person.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
...Yes. I blended right in. I borrowed Ms. Crane's clothes and... Ouch! "You mustn't embarrass the dead like that!" I know... I also thought it was pretty heartless to leave her exposed like that... So when the Conductor wasn't looking, I covered her up in the raincoat that was up for auction.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So she was the one who put the red raincoat on the victim...)</span> And then, the auction resumed as if nothing had happened.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
I reckon I took the picture of her in the red raincoat after that. That'd make all the facts line up.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lotta:<br />
After I took the photo, I went over to the lift to sneak a peek down below. I witnessed the 11 participants, and then I high-tailed it back behind the statue.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't tell me... You were hiding there the entire time until we found you?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Nah, that's... How should I put it...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...? What is it? Did something happen?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
I didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
S-So something did happen!
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
I-It ain't no big deal! Kinda embarrassin' to say, though. There was this huge *THUMP* sound all of a sudden... I was a liiiittle surprised by that. It was right after I had just witnessed a murder, so I was shakin' in my foots... My hear sorta tightened up, and I was off to la-la land... When I woke up, it was already the next day, 'round the time y'all came by the storeroom.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. So there was a large sound... Ms. Hart, I take it you do not know what transpired in the storeroom beyond this point?
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
I-I guess. But after the auction, all the masks were properly returned... So I reckon the participants had exited through the storeroom, just like I done said!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... Ms. Jenson, what were your actions after the auction resumed?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
I took the victim's place and participated in the auction. The Conductor instructed me to win the the bid for the costume trunk... ...because the body was inside it. It would have been bad if another auction guest won the bid for it...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You didn't realize the box was empty?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
No. We only found out when I came up to the storeroom to pay the bill. The Conductor was with me and told me to go search for her immediately. And then... I found another girl collapsed in front of the ladder!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay...
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Yes. She probably fell down from the rood and lost consciousness.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
Maybe the victim left the hatch open when she went up to the rooftop.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I understand now. Kay was surprised at seeing the collapsed victim and did not notice the open hatch. She must have missed her footing and fell down into the storeroom. Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.
</p><p>Lotta:<br />
That mighta been it. Though I reckon it'd be kinda pathetic to faint over something like that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
When Ms. Jenson found the unconscious Kay... ...Ms. Hart was also unconscious behind the statue. The situation is becoming clearer to me. Ms. Jenson, please continue your story.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
After I found Kay and the victim, I... put them both in the trunk. If the customers at the auction found out, there would've been a huge commotion.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Was this an order from the Conductor as well?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Yes, it was... But, since I secretly decided to put the raincoat on Ms. Crane... ...I had to dispose of the raincoat without the Conductor noticing.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh... So the Conductor didn't anticipate the raincoat becoming another piece of evidence.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
And, finally... ...we dressed Ms. Crane in a spare Conductor's outfit.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. In doing so, you made the victim appear as if she was the Conductor.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
In the end, the auction ended without anyone noticing anything.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... Ms. Jenson. Your crimes have become clear. If you know anything else, please hold nothing back.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
I want to help you more... but that is all I know... Umm, if I had to say, there is just one thing that bothers me. When I took Ms. Crane's place, I borrowed her clothes... ...but there was no way for me to borrow her hair... Ouch! "What kinda coroner's assistant goes around stealin' a corpse's hair?"
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I would think that robbing the deceased of their clothes would be questionable enough...)</span>
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Both the color and the length of our hair is different, so I was worried about how to disguise it. However, the Conductor even had a wig prepared for me. In fact... he had two of them. Inside the costume trunk, there was both a straight wig and a wavy wig.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Two wigs...? Why were there two?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Who knows...? Maybe it was a precaution, in case the victim had changed her hairstyle...? I ended up using the straight wig to match Ms. Crane's hair.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that means the wavy wig was left unused...)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Karin's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Is that really all you know?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Yes... Yup, that's really all I know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So that means you don't know who the Conductor is?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
...I'm sorry. I only knew that person as the auction conductor... I never saw that person without a mask on. The Conductor seemed to be on guard... towards everybody.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Nngh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(At this rate...!)</span>
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth, is that all you've got? Even if that little nurse is an accomplice, it changes absolutely nothing, y'know? In the end, the true culprit is still Kay Faraday. All you did was add another criminal, y'know. The rule of law cannot be overturned. At least, not for your sake.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Argh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I was shot down by the Debestes! What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.)</span>

Mr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
It was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction... Namely, an auction gavel.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
An auction gavel? We didn't find anything like that!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
If the culprit is the Conductor, it is possible that the gavel may be murder weapon. However... that alone is not reason enough, wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Of course, I have proof to back it up! <span style="color:green">This piece of evidence proves that the murder weapon is the auction gavel...</span>

Take a look at this piece of evidence. This proves the murder weapon is the auction gavel!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Miles Edgeworth. I don't know what you're trying to say... ...but if you don't want to fall prey to my whip, then stop spouting that nonsense!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nnghhoooh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(But you already hit me, regardless! Wasn't there something different after the gavel had been used as the murder weapon? I should take another look at the evidence.)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

Heh. I can and I will.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
According to Ms. Hart's testimony, after the victim had been murdered... ...it seems she suddenly stopped hearing the sound of the gavel during the auction. However, she had been able to hear it up until then. Why was that... you ask? It was because it had been used as the murder weapon and was covered in the victim's blood... ...it became necessary to dispose of it. Isn't that right? Blaise Debeste!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
.........
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...I'll have a search for the murder weapon performed immediately.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha! Well... Good luck with that, y'know. You've gotta work as hard as you can while you're young, y'see.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's completely confident that we won't find it...!)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Well then, while the search for the murder weapon continues... I hereby call for a brief recess.

Order in the court. Prosecutor von Karma. Your report, please.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
......I have a bad news. We've searched every inch of the Grand Tower, but... ...the auction gavel was nowhere to be found.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kh...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...That is most unfortunate. It seems... I am left with no choice, but to pronounce a verdict.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Well... it sure seems that way, y'know. Normally, you wouldn't commit a blunder like leaving behind the murder weapon, y'know. The best criminals would never do something like that, y'see.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Urk..... I don't have enough information! Is this as far as I can go...!?)</span>
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Yes, yes. It's a shame, y'know. But it can't be helped, y'see. This takes me back, y'know. All those defendants who came to me, asking for a plea bargain. They trusted me, y'know. Told me every one of their dirty little secrets, y'see. And when it came time for the trial, I'd get them sentenced to life in prison... Th-They... were all completely dumbstruck, y'know. Each and every one of them... Ha ha ha...! Oh, how I wish you all could have seen it, y'know... th-the stupid look on their faces!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I shall hereby announce my verdict. Please humbly accept the words of the Law.

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The defendant... Blaise Debeste! I hereby indict you!

What...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
..........Oh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I have here, documents regarding a certain case. The IS-7 Incident... A case that happened 18 years ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Documents... you say? Why would you suddenly...? Wait... you don't mean...! On the day of the crime, the record of your keycard being used was because...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I came to this room to fetch these documents, of course. Although... when I entered the meeting room... ...it seems it was before the black market auction had begun. At first I told you that I came to gather documents about you, Prosecutor Edgeworth... At that time, I simply could not tell you the truth.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
What are you doing, Justine!? Why are you indicting Pops!? Without any basis... th-this is slander!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That was a wonderful remark, Sebastian!
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
...Huh? R-Really?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Of course there is a basis. During the case 18 years ago... ...Prosecutor Manfred von Karma "<span style="color:#E16935">fabricated</span>" information regarding the body.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That was because the body of the sculptor, Isaac Dover, had been stolen...)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Papa "<span style="color:#E16935">fabricated</span>" information about a body? What do you mean...!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Detective Lacer, who handled the initial investigation, reported that the body had gone missing. However, in order to deceive Prosecutor von Karma... ...there is a person who purposely did not report to him that the body had disappeared!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What did you say...!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That person would not forgive those who defied him, nor would he allow others to hold power. He would use any means necessary, in order to bend others to his will. And then... also 18 years ago... ...Director Young, was ordered by a certain individual to write a <span style="color:#E16935">fake autopsy report</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Dr. Young was the one who wrote the autopsy report for the IS-7 Incident!?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So Ms. Jenson... was being threatened. Was the Conductor who threatened you... Blaise Debeste?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Th-That... I don't know. The person who threatened me was the auction conductor. They do have similar physiques, but I never saw the person's face...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Any trivial thing is fine! Give us a characteristic that could be a clue...!
</p><p>Karin:<br />
......Th-That's right! The Conductor's mask, it <span style="color:#E16935">exposed just a tiny part of his face</span>. There was a <span style="color:#E16935">tattoo</span> there. I'm sure of it!

</p><p>Blaise:<br />
I really have no idea what you're talking about, y'know. As you can see, there are clearly no tattoos on my face, y'see. So that person doesn't match me at all, y'know. The person who threatened her, this so-called Conductor... I wonder who it is, y'know. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Crane was... y'know. You say she was pursuing me? My, my. I didn't really know her that well, y'know. I don't mind girls chasing after me, y'know. But I don't recall her ever falling for me, y'see.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...You didn't know the victim well? That is a testimony we haven't heard up until now. Before the eyes of the Goddess of Law, you shall give us an official testimony!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
...I see, I see. Everyone is bullying me. I-If you're gonna go that far... That's fine, y'see... I'll just have to make you disappear.......... Every last one of you.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall cooperate with you as well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
If we let this opportunity slip by, I doubt we will ever get him to stand in court again. Please. do not let this chance go to waste...

Yes..... I promise I will live up to your expectations.

Yes, yes, Sebastian. If you're gonna stick up for me, be sure to have a clear basis, y'know.

Yes, yes. ...You really are pure, y'know?

That person... he really loves his father, doesn't he...?

Th-That's right! There's no contradiction at all! There's no way there can be a contradiction! Not for my Pops...!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Sebastian. I understand why you don't want to admit it. However... if you avert your eyes from the truth, you will regret it forever.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
! P-Pops... I... Just what should I do...!?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
......Hah. I really wonder... Why you're such an idiot, y'know? Sebastian. If you really wanna save me, you'll have to try a little bit harder, y'see... Gotta use your head, y'know? ...Honestly, you really are a useless idiot.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
N-No way...! But, I tried real hard... I tried my best, Pops! I went to the school you told me to go, reached the top of my class, just like you told me to! Just look at this jacket! Only someone who graduates at the top of his class gets to wear it! I did everything you told me to do! That's how I got to be the best at the academy! I even won all those awards, just so I could be like you, Pops...!

</p><p>Debeste:<br />
...!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Y'know those gold stars you got on your tests, I made the teachers give them to you. Every speech and debate contest, all of the judges were my friends. Y'know, Sebastian. If you weren't even able to notice something like that... ...you're really not worthy of being called my son. Don't you think?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Ah... ah... ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAaaaaaaaahhh!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Awww... Even my son has disappeared... Ah ha ha ha ha ha... Oh my... It's enough to make me cry, y'know. H-He was trying his best for me, and yet, he was totally useless, y'know...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You are truly a despicable person. As the Chairman of the P.I.C., and as a father...!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Even I feel sorry for that foolish prosecutor.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...Poor Mr. Prosecutor...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Blaise Debeste! You... Just what do you think of your own son!?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
He's just a useless pawn, y'see. Whoa now. Maybe you should look in the mirror before you criticize me, y'know. I mean, even you... you also used Sebastian to get close to me, didn't you?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I cannot deny that. However... he is not a mere "pawn"! He always tried to do his very best, even if the results aren't up to par. I've seen just how hard he tries. ...And yet, you refuse to even acknowledge it...!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. That was my intention... from the beginning. <span style="color:#0070C0">(If there was a burn mark on the Conductor's face... ...then Blaise Debeste must be hiding it. What was he wearing during the auction? That is... key to revealing the truth!)</span>

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
If you would recall Ms. Jenson's testimony. There's still one point that remains unexplained. Two types of <span style="color:#E16935">wigs</span> had been prepared, one of which was left unused.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Do you mean the wavy wig...?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...What are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It was something Ms. Jenson found when she switched places with the victim.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What does something like that have to do with the burn!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Inside the costume trunk, Ms. Jenson witnessed <span style="color:#E16935">two wigs</span>. One of them had been used by Ms. Jenson to make her look like the victim. Now then, just what was the other wig used for?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...It doesn't seems like it was a spare wig.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There's no need to overthink it. Just compare the attire of the true culprit, the Conductor, with that of Blaise Debeste.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
......! D-Don't stare at me like that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't you think there's just one spot where there is a huge contradiction? Specifically, around his face.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
! So that's...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...Not a wig at all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. ...It was no wig. Blaise Debeste! It was your fake beard!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
A... Ah ha ha... This is... a real beard, y'know. Don't tease me like that, Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Your son must have realized the truth before anyone else. That's why he was trying so desperately to protect you. You were also worried that he would tell the truth... Isn't that why you drove your son away from here? Because... he knew that his father was hiding a burn under his fake beard!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
G... Grr...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Blaise Debeste! How about you remove that fake beard of yours!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Y... YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHITBURNSITBURNSTHEGOGGLESDONOTHING!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah... A burn mark...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Justice has been served before the Goddess of Law... For that, I give you my thanks.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...I should be the one thanking you.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Blaise Debeste! I hereby announce my verdict! You shall be taken into custody for the murder of Jill Crane!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">April 6, 9:44 AM<br />Grand Tower<br />P.I.C. Meeting Room</span></center>
<p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth... Thank you very much. I am so happy that you believed in me to the very end!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...There's no need to thank me. As a prosecutor... No, as a friend, I simply wanted to save you.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I bring good tidings. It seems that former Chairman Debeste has been safely detained in the detention center. However, the search for the murder weapon, the auction gavel, continues... Blaise Debeste is a shrewd man. There is a good chance that he has already disposed of it. There is also... one piece of testimony that concerns me. Blaise Debeste mentioned that the only thing he did not fake were the letters.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...What do you mean?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
First, he found this letter in Jill Crane's clothes... Then, he also found this letter on Kay, who was unconscious in the storeroom. The contests of the letters seem to suggest that the two had been corresponding with each other... Which is why Blaise Debeste assumed that the two were working together.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ridiculous. That can't be right.)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
After reading the two letters, he decided to pin the crime on Kay Faraday. In order to cast suspicion on her, he planted one of the letters in a noticeable spot... ...the deceased Jill Crane's left breast pocket.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Isn't that just an excuse?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. That is what I thought as well. It may have simply been a last-ditch effort to save himself. However, before the stern eyes of the Goddess of Law, these are all trivial matters. His crime shall certainly not go unpunished. With this, I have finally fulfilled one of my long-standing missions.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Judge Courtney. Will you tell me what you know? Why did Blaise Debeste murder Jill Crane? And what lies hidden behind this case?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. I don't mind. You have the right to know everything. Long ago, Jill Crane was in love with a cameraman. That man was pursuing the black market auction as a journalist. And then... before he could reach the truth, he was erased.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
......
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise. ...Although in the end, she was the one who was murdered instead...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see... So that's what happened.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
While the Goddess of Law cannot condone her actions... ...we have succeeded in her goal of bringing Blaise Debeste's crimes to light.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So, Judge Courtney's goal was to expose Blaise Debeste... ...and reveal the <span style="color:#E16935">dark secrets</span> of the P.I.C.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Umm... By the way, what happened to the young prosecutor...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...We have been unable to contact him for some time now.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Do you have any idea where he might be...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I... had not been truly working for him, so...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I see... I feel very sorry for him.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...What you should be sorry for, is the fact that he was kept in the dark until now. No matter how cruel reality is, he will have to accept it. If he can't... he won't be able to walk his own path in life. ...Ever.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...A father's influence is not something that is easily erased. However, I'm sure he will be able to change from here on out.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yes... That's right. Surely... You must be right. Will I too... be able to walk my own path in life...?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Kay! Is your body alright!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Y-Yes. Thanks to you...
</p><p>Karin:<br />
I'm so sorry! Even though you're my patient... ...you ended up getting suspected because of me... Ouch! "You can't just take care of the patient's body. You gotta take care of the heart too." That's my Granny! Kay, how are your memories?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I feel like... I'm on the verge of remembering something...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That would be the trial for the murder of Horace Knightley... Who's in charge of the defense?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ms. Crane was supposed to be her defense attorney, but now that she has passed away... ...we are currently arranging for a replacement defense attorney.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Jill Crane had been in charge of Patricia Roland's defense!?)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I'll also have to get in contact with Sebastian quickly, since he's the prosecutor in charge... Well then...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah...! P-Please wait! What about Mr. Edgeworth's prosecutor's badge? What will happen... to his prosecutor's badge?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
With the chairman's arrest, the P.I.C. is no longer functional... ...so I cannot answer that question easily. Perhaps one should say... Only the Goddess of Law knows?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
B-But that's...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...You don't need to worry about me. This is the path that I have chosen.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
It seems you have no plans to change it either.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Of course not. I chose this path to seek the truth.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...With the departure of Blaise Debeste, the Law has once again returned to our hands. If you truly desire to continue the prosecutor's path... ...I am willing to assist you in reclaiming your badge.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I appreciate the sentiment... but I must decline. I did not relinquish my badge with half-hearted feelings.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I see... It seems that our paths of Law will continues to run counter to each other.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Heh. Until our paths cross once again, I shall have you hold onto that badge.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That was my intention from the start.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
.....
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...However, on occasion, the Goddess of Law is quite generous. Please return this notebook to its proper owner.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay's "Promise Notebook"!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
It seems this was scheduled to be put up for bidding at the black market auction. The name "Kay" is written on the notebook. It seems Blaise Debeste quickly realized this belonged to the girl. Since the letters he found also contained the same name...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You speak as if he really did not know about the letters. Are you saying that Blaise really did not prepare the letters himself?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. That man said so himself... Kay Faraday's goal was to steal back the notebook. Jill Crane's goal was to get revenge. In order to achieve their goals, the two teamed up to infiltrate the auction... or so he says. 
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unfortunately... this was all Blaise's misunderstanding. It was purely a coincidence. If the attorney from the P.I.C. and Kay really were acquaintances... ...it would be strange that she never mentioned it to me, considering her personality.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ha ha. You really do trust her, don't you?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.......
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
In the end, the notebook was used as another red herring, but... It's something that is very important to that girl, isn't it? I'll make a special exception and return it. I'm sure that's what the Goddess of Law desires.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's... Um.... I appreciate it.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I shall pray that she recovers her lost memories.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Umm... Is something wrong...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Kay. I am returning something very important to you.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah... This is...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Always greet people with a smile, even people you don't know. Never cry in front of strangers. Look, Daddy! I wrote them all down! Yup! I'll be sure to follow all of our promises, and become a hero just like you, Daddy! ...Ah! That's right! There was one more... I forgot to write down the most important promise! Promise number five... Always try your hardest to learn about things you don't understand! Eheheh... I'll be sure to remember. I'll never, ever forget them!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
...Always try your hardest... to learn about things you don't understand... That's right... I'm... "I" am...! I am...! ...the "Great Thief" who steals the truth, Kay Faraday! I'm the Second Yatagarasu, and Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay... You remember!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Eheheh... It's kinda embarrassing, though. Thank you so much! It's all thanks to you, Mr. Edgeworth! Even when I lost my memories, you were still always trying to save me, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh... It seems you're back to normal.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Wow! Kay! You've gotten better! Your health comes first! Now you can relax! "Just make sure you don't run off and lose all your memories again."
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah... Ms. Jenson, Dr. Young! Thanks for worrying about me.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
"Hey. If you're feeling all better, how about changing back into your own clothes?" I washed your clothes for you, Kay, so they're nice and clean!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
These clothes... Wasn't Detective Gumshoe holding on to them?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
He said forensics was done with them, so he gave them back to me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Have they revealed the results of the analysis yet?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Hmm... To be honest, I actually didn't think to ask about that... Now, now! More importantly, let's hurry up and get you changed, Kay!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm. Still... Isn't it better if we do not remove her bandages?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Ah. She should be fine now. Kay just bumped her head. She didn't really have any other major injuries.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then... Why was she so heavily bandaged?
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Better safe than sorry! A pound of prevention is worth an ounce of cure! That's my motto!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What a troublesome motto...)</span>
</p><p>Karin:<br />
Come on, Kay! Let's get you dressed up over there!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Now, this is definitely what a Great Thief should look like!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...A smile certainly suits you best. In the past... and now as well.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ms. von Karma... Thank you for coming too!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I-I... I only came because Scruffy asked me to. That Scruffy, he also wanted to see your energetic self again.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Gummy...! What happened to Gummy!?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Who knows... Maybe he was disgusted with the man who willingly threw away his prosecutor's badge?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Detective Gumshoe...)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...I must be going soon. I'll be taking these ladies in for questioning.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah... What's going to happen to the two of them?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
One aided in the murder of an attorney, the other forged an autopsy report 18 years ago... Those crimes definitely won't disappear. Of course... I will mention in court that they were being blackmailed by Blaise.
</p><p>Karin:<br />
We'll be just fine! As long as Granny's by my side, we're invincible!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Well then, take care.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now then... Kay. Sorry to ask so soon right after you regained your memories, but I have some questions.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Sure! Ask me anything you want!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What were you doing on the day you lost your memories?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
On that day... I was asked to come to Gourd Lake. I don't know who called me there, though. As I was watching the moon at Gourd Lake... ...a person in a red raincoat approached me! All of a sudden, he used some kind of drug to knock me out!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What is she saying? The place where Kay saw the moon was at Gourd Lake?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
When I woke up, it seems I somehow ended up on the roof of the Grand Tower. My mind was still in a daze, so I stumbled around for a bit... That's when I found the person in the red raincoat, collapsed! I was startled. And when I stepped back in panic... ...I fell from a high place and got knocked out cold again! And, when I woke up, all my memories were gone. The person in the red raincoat... Who exactly was that person? Oh yeah... I was certain that I saw them walking in mid-air... Hmm... Somehow, this is all starting to make my head hurt!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Please calm down. You're just a little confused because you've only recently gotten your memory back. Most likely, this is the main cause of your confused memories...

Your memories were confused because you had been in two similar locations. The person that you first saw could not have been walking in mid-air. They were simply walking on the ground at Gourd Lake Park. You must have gotten that scene confused with the Grand Tower rooftop.

Doesn't this piece of evidence create a contradiction in your testimony?

Hrmmm... I wonder. What do you think, Sebastian?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
I don't really understand, but I don't think so.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
I know, right? That's what I was thinking as well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ugh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's with this father and son tag team...!)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth, it's fine. Why don't we just give up...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay. It's still much too early to give up. I will definitely prove your innocence.

Mr. Edgeworth...

Blaise Debeste! Take a look at this piece of evidence.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
What's wrong, Edgeworth? You're getting all fired up. Maybe you should cool your head and think it over once again. 'Cause I don't have time to put up with something as meaningless as that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nnghhoooh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(So that was wrong!)</span>
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth. You really think someone like you can defeat my pops!? Pops is super important, you know!

Yes, yes. You're embarrassing me, Sebastian, so please stop, OK?

Blaise Debeste. Take a look at this piece of evidence and tell me what you think!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
What do I think? Absolutely nothing at all... Right, Sebastian?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Yeah, Pops. That has nothing to do with your testimony just now!

</p><p>Kay:<br />
It looks like Mr. Debeste has gotten a bit livelier, hasn't he?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. He probably feels a lot more confident with his father backing him up. However, I will break through that confidence of the Debeste father and son duo.
