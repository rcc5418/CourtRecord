...three, four, five, six, seven, eight... What time is it? It's nine! Ten, eleven...
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
Sh-Shisho's dead...? No... D-Do you think... HE did it?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh, no! I-If he did... then wh-what do we do?!
</p><p>???:<br />
Hey, pull yourself together!
</p><p>???:<br />
Don't worry. I have an idea...

<center><span style="color:green">May 13, 9:45 AM<br />District Court- Defendant Lobby No. 6</span></center>
<p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What the heck! Who brings a defendant to his own trial late?! Plus, the request was so last-minute, I didn't even have a chance to talk with my client!)</span>
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">He's late, he's late, for a very important date!</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Athena Cykes</span>. Armed with analytical psychology, and a full arsenal of legal know-how... I'm a fully-competent defender of the Wright Anything Agency! Though I wish my client would show up already -- the trial's about to start...
</p><p>???:<br />
Heh. It appears we made it just in time.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Where have you BEEN?! The trial's about to start, <span style="color:#E16935">Simon</span>!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
You needn't get so worked up, Athena. His Baldness can wait.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
There's no way he'd wait for me! And besides, why would I want to start off on the wrong foot with him right out of the gate?!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Dealing with such matters is part of being a lawyer, if I'm not mistaken.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yeah, well, covering for your lateness is not!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. Still but a rank amateur, I see...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
This is <span style="color:#E16935">Simon Blackquill</span>. He might not look it, but he's actually a prosecutor, and a psychology specialist. He and I go way back... As for our shared specialization in psychology... ...we're both disciples of the same person so to speak, but he's kinda my senior, I guess. But twisted sense of humor or no, I wish he'd stop treating me like a child all the time.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
So, where are Wright-dono and Justice-dono?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Mr. Wright is abroad, and Apollo is helping Trucy with her magic show. Didn't I tell you?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
They're what? So neither one of them are here? ...Leaving you to take this on alone?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yep!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Ye gods... Call Wright-dono back. It's not too late.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh no, not too late at all! He would only need to know how to teleport.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Tsk. Very well... Then I will settle for Justice-dono. Go grab him by the horns and drag him here!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Apollo is literally in the middle of a show, Simon! You may not want to admit it, but I've got what it takes to take on this case! Just leave this to me and go watch from the gallery!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
...As your defense derails in a spectacular fashion?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
No... As I win the heck out of this trial!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
..........
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I'll be okay -- promise! So wipe that look off your face already, will you? Anyway, I take it the guy behind you is...?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Yes, he's your... ......Tsk, he's asleep again. Hoy, Bucky! Wake up!
</p><p>???:<br />
Giyaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Owwwww... Whadja do DAT for, Simey...? *hic* ..........Hrrnhhh...? Who's dis yeller chickadee?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
She is your lawyer, such as it were. I'd say she's more "green" than "yellow" however.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Lawyer? She sure duzen't look it, dush she...? Is she, like, yer fellow apprentice or sumfin'...?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
...Heh, something like that. I've known her longer than I've known you. You could say we're bound to one another.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Ohhhh, m'kay... Well den. Geussh I better call 'er MIZ chickadee, den.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Simon... This guy's not only rude, but he's three sheets to the wind at his own trial...
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Eh heh heh, heh... *hic*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I know we just met, but... I'm about ready to give him a piece of my mind!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Do as you will. Just save it for after the trial.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Miz Chickadee...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Don't call me that!)</span>
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
How'd y'da...? Simey here'sh an old frienda mine... I'm the fourth-generation head chef o'"Whet Soba." "Whet Noodle No. 4," <span style="color:#E16935">Bucky Whet</span>! Nice to meetcha!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I-It's... nice to meet you, too, Mr. Whet. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So he CAN pull himself together when he wants to! <span style="color:#0070C0">Grr... If only the trial wasn't starting in a few minutes...)</span></span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Having been accused of a murder that only occurred yesterday... ...I'm afraid it's taken a toll on the poor boy.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
And you happened to be there at the theater where it all happened, too, right? They said they found a rakugo storyteller murdered in his dressing room.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Indeed. The victim, master storyteller <span style="color:#E16935">Taifu Toneido</span>, was a long time patron of Whet Soba. Master Toneido had been looking after Bucky ever since Whet Noodle No. 3 passed away.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I see. So the victim was kind of like a father to the defendant, huh.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Dat shtupid ol' fart... Like a father...?! Naw way! He was alwaysh disshing my soba...
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
How dare you speak ill of him? Running your mouth like that is why they suspected you of his murder in the first place! Now, pull yourself together. No. 3 must be rolling in his grave.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
...B-B-But Siiiiimey... *hic* Da police... None o' dem believesh me... Dey won' lishen t'me *sniffle*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like he's still in shock from the whole ordeal) </span>Don't worry, Mr. Whet. Everything's gonna be all right! I'm going to defend you with everything I've got. You're in good hands now!
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Y'mean... you believe me, ma'am...?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Of course! No matter what I'll believe in you to the very end!
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Gee whiz, Miz Chickadee...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Now c'mon, I need you to shape up -- just like those al dente noodles of yours!
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Yesh, ma'am...! My soba ish the freshesht... *urp*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
M-Mr. Whet!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />*sigh* Bucky, you great, big pillock.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So, uh, how exactly do you know this guy?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I used to frequent Whet Soba -- and still do, in fact -- so I've known him since he was a lad. That's why his father and Master Toneido were always so good to me.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...I didn't know you liked soba so much, Simon.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I wouldn't expect one such as you, who eats meat slapped between slabs of bread... ...to understand the delicate taste, and the subtle textures imparted by buckwheat flour.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hey, that's just rude!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
But I digress.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmph! I'm all about flavor and subtlety and stuff!)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
If I let Whet Soba end like this... ...I'll never be able to face No. 3 or Master Toneido in the next life.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Ah, I see... And that's why you came to me! You wanted someone you could trust!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
It was never my intention to ask YOU.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Grrrrr... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'll show him! I'll show him I can handle it just fine!)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Well, I believe it's about time.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What?! But we haven't even properly discussed the case yet!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
What's the matter? You look nervous, Athena. Don't tell me you're "chickadee"-ing out.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I-I'm just trembling with the excitement of battle -- that's all!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Auf geht's! Let's do this! Come on, Mr. Whet! Get up off the floor -- we've got a case to win!
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Yesh, Miz Chickadee... I'm gonna do my besht... *hic*
</p>
<center><span style="color:green">Whet Soba! Whet Soba!<br />Whet Soba! Whet Soba! Whet Soba!</span></center>
<p>Bucky:<br />
Yello! Two bowls of noodles...? Sorry sir, no can do... Kinda busy at the courthouse... Huh? Dey, dey hung up... Eh heh. Okay! Let'sh do dish... *hic*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...He's not going to do himself or his case any favors like this, Simon. Maybe we should let him go get some rest somewhere...?
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Lemme resht? Hah! Mehbee if I were a lump o' regular flour dough fer udon noodles! But I'm fresh, like my soba! 'N y'don't let soba dough resht... 'S all about the "<span style="color:#E16935">three freshes</span>"! Grind da buckwheat seeds fresh, cut da dough fresh, and boil da noodles fre-- *urp*
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
H-He's blacked out!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, boy. I just KNEW something like this would happen) </span>Simon, what are these "<span style="color:#E16935">three freshes</span>" of soba he was talking about?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
First, buckwheat seeds, or "groats," are ground to make buckwheat flour. Then dough made with the flour is cute with a large, rectangular knife into noodles. And, finally, the buckwheat noodles are boiled. Each step is done immediately, one after the other, so that the soba is <span style="color:#E16935">fresh</span> when eaten.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh, so that's what he meant. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I wouldn't want him to make me any soba right now, though, that's for sure.)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Athena, this is no time for idle chatter. You need to get into the courtroom, now. Just remember: as a prosecutor, I will be unable to lend you a hand. So don't expect any help from my quarter.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
There you go, treating me like I'm incompetent again! For your information, I wasn't planning on asking you for help anyway! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Grrr! Just you wait, Simon! I'll show you! <span style="color:#0070C0">Mr. Wright and Apollo may not be here... .<span style="color:#0070C0">..but that's all right. I can do this on my own!</span>)</span></span>

<center><b>Day 1<br />Court Is Now In Session<br />All Rise</b></center>
<p>Judge:<br />
Court is now in session for the trial of Bucky Whet.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
The defense is ready, Your Honor!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The prosecution is fully prepared, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What's this? No prayer this time, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
That is correct, Your Honor. To expedite these proceedings, I completed them beforehand in the lobby.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How very thoughtful of you. By the way, what brings you back to this country?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth himself called on me to handle this case. Besides, I have a debt to repay. And though my opponent is yet a callow thing... I have no qualms with sending her down to hell.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
If you have a score to settle, it's with Apollo, not me! But more importantly... I am not a "callow thing." I'm a qualified and capable attorney!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Then what is that yellow attire, if not proof of your immaturity, you small, spring chick? Now, cease your shrill chirping.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, now, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. She is still only a teenager. Please go easy on her.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Great! Now even the judge is giving me the kid treatment!)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Very well. Shall we begin, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm, I suppose we should. Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, please give your opening statement.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'll show them what I can do! They'll be sorry they underestimated me!)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Certainly. Let the last rites of the victim commence. The incident is believed to have occurred at around 4 PM yesterday, May 12... at a storytellers' theater called "Kurukuru Tei." The victim was a great master of the Toneido school of "rakugo," or "comedic storytelling." His name was <span style="color:#E16935">Taifu Toneido</span>. The scene of the murder was the theater's dressing room. It is accessible via the stall entrance hallway, and has an inner and outer sliding door.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Backstage Diagram added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The estimated time of death is between 2 PM and 5 PM. The cause of death is suffocation, though how the victim suffocated is yet to be determined. The autopsy report found nothing unusual in his lungs or stomach, and there is no murder weapon. I will now submit the incident report to the court.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Crime Scene Report added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Taifu's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! How can you name Mr. Whet as the culprit... when you don't know how the victim was killed -- or even with what?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
While it is true that the weapon and precise method are, as yet, unknown... the accused is the only one who had the opportunity to commit the murder. I will explain this assertion in further detail as we continue.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh. I guess this means he has some kind of evidence to present...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Now, would the accused care to plead his case?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Come to think of it, where IS the defendant, Ms. Cykes?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
S-Sorry, Your Honor. But I'm afraid Mr. Whet isn't feeling very well, and is resting in the infirmary.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Surely it is the lack of a clear conscience that impedes him from facing this court.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Great. Starting off on the wrong foot already...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Mr. Whet is the head chef of a soba shop frequented by the victim. On the day of the incident, Mr. Whet went to the theater at the victim's request. Taifu Toneido was a connoisseur of soba. As you can see in these photographs... he was apparently making soba himself in his dressing room that very day. The soba found at the scene is likely the soba he himself made there.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Liking soba is one thing, but making it in a theater dressing room's a bit much, non?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Master Toneido truly had a passion for soba, didn't he? For a man like that to be murder by a soba chef is simply unthinkable.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And yet, the accused had ample motive. For in the victim's safe, we discovered the deed to the accused's shop. Mr. Whet was to inherit Whet Soba when he lost his father recently. However, it's believed the victim stole the shop's deed during the transfer process. The prosecution believes the accused killed the victim in order to get the deed back.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Whet Soba Deed added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... A murder over the deed to a shop... That does sound like a plausible motive.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So THAT'S what this case is about... I wish Simon had filled me in a little better... I could've contributed more than just a thousand buckets of cold sweat if he had...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Defense. From your demeanor, I gather you know very little about the details of this case.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
W-Well, you see...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d8/SoJ_Satorha%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420132507" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Satorha!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d8/SoJ_Satorha%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420132507" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="SoJ Satorha!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Satorha%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You are dishonoring the soul of the victim by appearing in the courtroom unprepared. You are an embarrassment to your profession, you <span style="color:#E16935">putrid egg yolk</span>!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Eeeeeek! I-I'm sorry! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Apollo's a "red pepper," and now, I'm an "egg yolk"?! We've only just started and I've already been demoted from "spring chick"...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I am ready to call my witness, Your Honor. Let us listen to the words of one who was present when the crime was discovered.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Someone who was there when the victim's body was found?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Witness, please take the stand.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Nahyuta:<br />
Witness, please state your name and occupation.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Simon Blackquill... Prosecutor.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
P-Prosecutor Blackquill! You didn't tell me you were going to take the stand!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
There simply wasn't time.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
What a shame, Prosecutor Blackquill. Had you shared the <span style="color:#E16935">damning scene</span> you witnessed beforehand with the defense... we could've moved this trial along, and saved the victim's soul that much faster.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">("D-<span style="color:#E16935">Damning scene</span>"...? What in the world did Simon see?)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, was it? Before I give my testimony, there's something I'd like to confirm.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
By all means.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
This case involves "<span style="color:#E16935">rakugo</span>," a very traditional form of Japanese comedic storytelling. Do you have enough knowledge of this art form to handle the case competently?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Are you implying that I am not qualified for this case?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Not yet -- I am simply trying to ascertain your familiarity with the topic... for now.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It is the prosecutor's duty to learn the background of any case he takes on. I did some rakugo last night, and have grasped the overall idea of it.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. How much could you possibly grasp in a single night?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Rakugo is a form of entertaining storytelling that originated in the land of Japan. In it, the storyteller sits alone on the stage, with only a fan and a towel as... and the rakugo artist tells long, whimsical stories, giving each character a distinct voice. This traditional art was originally invented by monks to make sermons more interesting. Are you satisfied? If not, I could explain the twelve types of endings to such stories... or shall I perform the famous story of Jugemu instead?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Augh! I-It appears you have put in a bit of study...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Your acknowledgement is most welcome, Prosecutor Blackquill.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I can see why you are know for being quite thorough in your research, prosecutor. Now, I would love to see you perform that story you mentioned, if you don't mind.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
If that is Your Honor's request... Jugemu, Jugemu--

<p>Blackquill:<br />
I went to the theater yesterday, and arrived at... approximately 4 PM.<br />
I went straight to Master Tonedio's dressing room to say hello.<br />
Bucky went into the dressing room thereafter, only to come storming out a while later.<br />
Master Toneido's junior disciple, <span style="color:#E16935">Uendo</span>, apparently then entered the room soon after.<br />
That's when Unedo discovered Master Toniedo's body.

<p>Athena:<br />
N-Now, wait just a minute here, Prosecutor Blackquill! W-With a testimony like that... you're practically accusing Mr. Whet of the crime!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Prosecutor Blackquill, what did you go to the theater for in the first place?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I went because I had received an invitation from Master Toneido. Here, see for yourself. It was a special show commemorating his junior disciple <span style="color:#E16935">Uendo</span>'s promotion. It was also an occasion to announce the boy's succession to the stage name of "Uendo II."
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Um, so what exactly does it mean to "succeed to a stage name"?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. You really don't know, do you? In the performing arts, a name succession is when an artist inherits a predecessor's name.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I see. So there was another "Uendo" rakugo artist before, and this disciple succeeded him, huh. And what did your invitation say?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
It contained a simple letter of salutations and an outline of the show's program.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Oh! It appears Taifu Toneido was going to perform "Tokisoba," or "Time Soba." He's famous for his masterful pantomime of eating soba, using only his fan as a prop. And Uendo was to peform "Soba Sei," or "Soba Glutton." A soba-themed show, I see!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
It seems you know a thing or two about rakugo yourself, Your Baldness. The first to perform was the senior disciple, <span style="color:#E16935">Geiru</span>, followed by Uendo... and, lastly, Master Toneido.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Invitation added to Court Record</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I see. So that's why you happened to be at the storytellers' theater yesterday. So what happened after you arrived?

</p><p>Athena:<br />
And how did Master Toneido appear when you said hello to him?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I went with the intention of greeting him, but ultimately, we didn't actually meet.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Y-You didn't see him? Why not?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Geiru escorted me to the dressing room... but we heard the sound of rakugo being performed from within. Thinking the master was rehearsing, we decided to wait in the hall until he was done.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You heard rakugo being performed in the dressing room.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Yes. Not just me, but Geiru as well.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
In other words, you can confirm that the victim was still alive at around 4 PM?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Correct. I couldn't hear him clearly through the doors, but I'm sure it was Master Toneido. I could tell because it was "Time Soba" routine being performed in there.

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Please tell us in detail how Mr. Whet appeared at the time.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Geriu and I were waiting in the hallway for Master Toneido to finish practicing... when Bucky appeared and entered the dressing room with his thing.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What happened after that?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
We heard what sounded like Bucky shouting inside the room. About ten minutes later, Bucky came back out of the dressing room looking rather irate.
</p><p>Nahyura:<br />
This is most likely when the murder was committed. The victim was an elderly man. It would've been entirely possible to kill within the span of ten minutes.

</p><p>Athena:<br />
What do you mean by "apparently"? Didn't you see him go in?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
No, I couldn't. I wasn't able to see the dressing room door from where I was standing at the time. But Geiru was right in front of it, so I'm sure she saw it all.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I-I see. And why do you suppose Uendo went to the dressing room anyway?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
He had just finished his routine, so he was making a courtesy call. A disciple is to pay their master respect tight before and after each performance.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
And all disciples are expected to do this?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Yes, it's common courtesy among rakugo artists.

<p><i>After pressing all statements:</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Well done, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your testimony has given us quite a glimpse into the sequence of events.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Thank you, Prosecutor Blackquill. And now, please allow me to summairze your testimony. While Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru were in the hallway waiting for Master Toneido... the accused came along and entered the dressing room with some items in tow. He was heard shouting for a time inside the dressing room. About ten minutes later, he came back out of the room, seeming rather angry. A short time after the accused had come and gone, Uendo Toneido went into the room. A few minutes later, after having discovered the victim's body, Uendo gave a scream... and came running out into the hallway from within. Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru then ran into the room and saw the body for themselves. From the circumstances, it is quite clear that the accused murdered the victim.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... This is crucial testimony indeed.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Simon's Statement added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Defense. An eyewitness has given conclusive testimony. Why not let it all go now, and allow the victim his last rites?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Not on your life! If Uendo went into the dressing, too, and was the first to discover the body... then who's to say HE didn't commit the crime!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Uendo was in the dressing room for a mere two, perhaps three minutes. He could not have possibly committed the murder in that time, nor without making any noise.

Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony was like the lowly opening act of a rakugo show. He may hold the title "prosecutor," but this time, he stood on the side of the defense. To restore balance to this trial, I would like to present an actual witness for the prosecution.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And who is this witness?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The person who was with Prosecutor Blackquill when the body was discovered. She is another entertainer of the Toneido School: Ms. <span style="color:#E16935">Geiru Toneido</span>.

Please state your name and occupation, witness.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Hello, everyone! I'm here to represent the Toneido School with a twisty, twist, twiist! And BLOOOON! There you have it! A stunning balloon hat! It's me! The balloon artist you all know and love, Geeeiru Toneidoooo! Just call me Geiru, sweetie! One, two... BLOOOON!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What a way to capture your audience's attention! I daresay I can't take my eyes off those balloons.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Please tell me you're talking about the hat, Your Honor...

Oh Mister Judgey! I'm so glad you liked my performance! Would you consider joining my fan club, pwetty pwease?

Oh, absolutely!

Well, my father -- my late father, that is -- was a rakugo artist, you see... So I joined the Toneido School to be just like my daddy someday!

Your distress is entirely understandable. And my condolences for your loss.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
And, and, not only that, but he...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Y-You have more to say about Mr. Whet?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Every time he comes to deliver soba to us, he yells at me! He always tells me to "get away!"
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Is there any reason why he would say such a thing to you?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
He says the smell of my perfume will get into his soba and ruin it! Like, how can he say that?! This is a greaaaat scent!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph! How very rude of him. I don't blame you for being upset.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Excuse me, Your Honor! But please don't let Geiru's "balloons" bias your judgement! Mr. Whet hasn't been proven guilty yet, remember?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Hmph. It will be interesting to see how long that fire of yours will last, defense. Now then Geiru. Please share the truth with this court.

Thats my doggie! I keep him at the theater. Let's see... With a twisty, twist, twiiist! And BLOOOON! There you have it! My cute widdle Judgemu!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
He's... kinda creepy-looking...
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Oh, but he's a really, really good boy!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
A-And why was Jugemu barking? Do you think it's because he saw someone suspicious? If so, then we'd have a new suspect in this case.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Hmm... Now, why he was barking again...? Oh, I remember! Because it was time for me to feed him! So I went into his yard and gave him some food.
</p><p>Athena: <br />
Couldn't somebody have slipped into the dressing room while you were doing that?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Nope, the door out into the yard was wiiide open. I would've seen if anybody went into the dressing room.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Prosecutor Blackquill, come down to the stand for a sec... please!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. How many times must I do this?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You saw what Geiru was talking about, right? So why didn't you mention it before?!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph! I can't be expected to remember every minute detail!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, remember them now -- please! Did Geiru go out into the yard?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Yes. I remember now that she went to feed Jugemu. And I saw her looking towards the dressing room quite frequently as well.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Do you recall anything else?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
It looked as though she were feeding the dog a great quality of dumplings or something. Jugemu couldn't finish them all, so he buried the rest in a corner of the yard. That's about all I can remember.

Geiru was in the yard near the doghouse. Prosecutor Blackquill even saw her there. And while she was there, the door to the yard had been left open.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah! I see!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes, if the door to the yard was "wide open," as Geiru said... it would've blocked her view, making it impossible for her to see the dressing room!

"Hide the fact"? You speak as though you think she had something to do with the murder. Rather than a deliberate deception, it was more likely a simple oversight. Right witness?

Well... I... I was so shocked by what happened I was just confused, that's all.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Even though she is trying to keep up a brave front as an entertainer... the truth is that she is being torn apart by grief. For her mind to be in turmoil is hardly unexpected.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, it must be very difficult, indeed.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
To a disciple, one's master is akin to a real parent. Surely, her shock is immense. The way this lawyer tries to pin the blame on this poor soul at first opportunity... All I can say is... defense attorneys are heartless creatures indeed.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But I wasn't...! That was't what I was trying to do...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Is it beyond your comprehension, defense? Your unskilled argument is scarring this witness even further. And is we ask the people of this courtroom, I am sure they would agree.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What?! The gallery doesn't get a say in this!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Are you afraid to find out that they think ill of you? Or perhaps you are in the wrong? Listen to them now with that keen sense of hearing you are so proud of.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

That lawyer's still in training, isn't she? Why is she all by herself?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I hear the voices of the gallery... I can hear the voices of their hearts...! It's so intense... I feel so alone up here, fighting by myself...)</span>

<span style="color:#0070C0">(B-But I can't give up... I have to... I have to... keep pressing on...)</span> As long as there was a moment when nobody was watching the dressing room door... the defendant can't be convicted solely on Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru's testimonies!

Hmph. Even now, you would continue to resist? You are childish in defeat as well, I see.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I'm not out for the count yet, buster! I'm just getting started!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Despite your posturing, is it not true that your resolve could crumble at any moment? With a little push, you would surely succumb to despair. A little push such as with this piece of <span style="color:#E16935">conclusive evidence</span>.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">C-conclusive evidence</span>," huh?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
That is correct. We found a critical piece of evidence at the scene of the crime: The victim's <span style="color:#E16935">dying message</span>, which clearly implicates the accused, Bucky Whet! Look at these Japanese playing cards -- known as "<span style="color:#E16935">karuta</span>" -- lined up on the table. These special English-version karuta cards spell out a message. That message: "<span style="color:#E16935">WHET NO 4.</span>"
</p><p>Athena:<br />
"WHET NO 4" ...? Y-You mean, "<span style="color:#E16935">Whet Noodle No. 4</span>"?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes, "<span style="color:#E16935">Whet Noodle No. 4</span>," as the fourth head chef of Whet Soba is also known. The message points to none other than the accused, Bucky Whet!
</p><p>Athena:<br />

He's trying to use your keen sense of hearing against you to manipulate the trial, Athena. What a cheap trick for a supposedly holy man.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
S-Simon...!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
And you fopdoodles in the gallery! Can't a man watch a trial in peace?! This inexperienced amateur is about to turn the trial around!

</p><p>Athena:<br />

Prosecutor Blackquill! What are you doing at the defense's bench?!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. I grew bored of watching from the gallery. Besides, if I were to leave this trial to this spring chick... and lose my favorite soba shop in the process, I will be quite cross.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You voluntarily stand on the side of impurity and sin? Truly, what a fool you are.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
To think, you were so easily manipulated by his parlor tricks... What happened to "qualified and capable," Athena?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I-I just let my guard down a little bit! But it won't happen again!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. Then gird up your loins, and steel yourself for battle!

I was in prison for a long time. And "hell" sounds no worse than "cell," to be honest.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Ah, but the fires of hell will not be the end of your suffering. For the sin you have just committed, you shall surely be reborn as a <span style="color:#E16935">panda</span> in your next life. A white and black, <span style="color:#E16935">reverse panda</span>, that is. And you shall be put in a zoo, to be exposed to public ridicule.

The first to discover the body, and someone who witnessed the crime scene firsthand. Mr. <span style="color:#E16935">Uendo Toneido</span>. The time has come for that ponytailed pair over there to finally let it go, and move on.

Witness, please state your name and occupation.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
I am the rakugo storyteller Uendo Toneido. Even if my performance isn't worth watching, I will certainly watch my words. I wouldn't want to say anything thoughtless and get arrested. After all, that'd be... a "raku-no-no"! Hee hee! Thank you, everybody! Good night!

</p><p>Athena:<br />
You can't leave yet! You've only just introduced yourself!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Oh, my, my! Are you a fan of mine, miss? Would you like my autograph? One moment...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Ow! What do you think you're doing?!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
No need to stand on ceremony! My fan deserves a <span style="color:#E16935">fan</span>, after all. A "fan" for a "fan"! Nice one! Hee hee! Oh, why if it isn't Simon! How are you on this fine day, sir? Quite a dilly of a pickle we've found ourselves in, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I don't believe I've ever seen you talk quite so much, Uendo.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Never performed in a place like this, y'know. I got butterflies here, can't you see? Hee hee!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why do I always get the weird ones?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Pardon me, witness. As much as I enjoy your banter, I believe we had better return to the case at hand.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Ah, I suppose you're right. In that "case"... I was promoted to "futatsume" yesterday, and received the stage name "Uendo." The show was our way of celebrating my new name and "middle rank" standing! Hee! And then THAT happened... Haah... I never dreamed something like that'd happen, not in a million years. And just as I got my chance to start repaying my debt to Shisho, too... Yeah... Plus, I'm worried about Geiru... The way she clung to Shisho... Poor thing. I told her to keep a stiff upper lip... Stiff like <span style="color:#E16935">rigor mortis</span>... Keep telling those lame jokes, and Shisho'll come scold you from the grave! I wouldn't mind getting yelled at, you know, if it meant seeing him again.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Uendo, please... As charming as your various characters are, this isn't a rakugo stage.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Let us hear your testimony now, witness. Tell the court about the evidence left at the scene -- the proof of the accused's guilt.

<p>Uendo:<br />
I noticed Shisho's dying message right away.<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">stiff </span>cards were right next to the <span style="color:#E16935">stiff</span>, you see.<br />
Hey now, enough with the silly puns already! Hee hee!<br />
Anyway, I got the meaning right away. I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!<br />
That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth.<br />
It's so like Shisho not to write Bucky's name outright. "Plain and simple" wasn't his style.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Well! That was certainly a more entertaining testimony than usual. The variety of characters performed by the witness was absolutely splendid!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But he shouldn't be performing any characters in the first place, Your Honor! And, Uendo! The murder weapon hasn't been determined yet! So how can you say that the victim was drowned in soba broth?!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
It's obvious. All you have to do is look at the crime scene. He was found with his face shoved in a bowl. It's only natural to assume he was drowned in the broth for noodles!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Except we're not here to assume things, Uendo, so please stick to just the facts!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
My, my! It's so like a soba chef to kill someone this way, wouldn't you say? And with the karuta message he left behind, it's clear Bucky Whet did it!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Setting aside the issue of the murder weapon for now... that dying message certainly does seem to be irrefutable evidence.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Indeed. It proves the absolute guilt of the accused.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Urgh... Even I've gotta admit that I can't see how that message could mean anything else...
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Bucky used soba for the deed, all to get back the soba shop deed.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Nngh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(This testimony makes Mr. Whet look super guilty. I have to do something!)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. That's his "conclusive evidence"? What a farce!

What do you mean, Simon?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
What's this? I thought you said you weren't planning on asking me for help?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Arngh...! I did, and I won't, thank you very much!

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Uendo, when you saw the cards on the table... what made you think they were Master Toneido's dying message?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Well, it was a coded message right there next to the body. I'm sure anybody would've thought that they were  there to name his killer. I love murder mysteries, and often watch them on TV.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
O-Oh? I see.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
I saw a similar scene during a murder mystery marathon last Tuesday. That's what made me think, "This must be a dying message!"

</p><p>Athena:<br />
The cards were on the table next to your master's body was slumped over, right? You must've been surprisingly calm to notice them at the time.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
As I said, the <span style="color:#E16935">stiff</span> cards were right there next to the <span style="color:#E16935">stiff</span>, so they were hard to miss.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But wouldn't it have been more natural to notice the victim rather than the cards?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
The message just caught my eye, because the <span style="color:#E16935">stiff</span> cards were right next to the <span style="color:#E16935">stiff</span>.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes, but the fact hardly seems significant enough to make a person take not of them.

<span style="color:#E16935">Stiff</span> cards... next to the <span style="color:#E16935">stiff</span>...

It would've been no easy task, to be sure. But who knows? He wasn't an entertainer for fifty-five years for nothing.

Hmph. It's hard to say. It could simply be the eccentricity of an entertainer, or perhaps he's hiding something.

<p>Athena:<br />
There's a contradiction in Uendo's testimony!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And would you care to explain where, Ms. Cykes?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Certainly, Your Honor. According to the autopsy report, nothing unusual was found in the victim's lungs.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, yes. It does say that, doesn't it?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
.........
</p><p>Athena:<br />
If he HAD drowned in a bowl of soba, then there should've been soba broth in his lungs! But since there wasn't any... it means the victim was suffocated with something other than soba broth!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Pyoooooo!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
This is the contradiction you noticed, isn't it, Simon?

Heh. Not bad. Not bad at all.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Heh heh heh. I guess I showed you!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... But if drowning in the soba broth WASN'T the cause of death... then when was the victim's face thrust into that bowl?

Because no soba broth was discovered in the victim's lungs... his head would've been placed into the bowl AFTER he was killed! And that's when the soba broth must've been spilled onto the karuta cards. In other words, the victim could NOT have lined up the cards as he was drowning!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... I see. So it was done AFTER he was already dead... But why would the culprit do such a thing?

Heh... You boast of psychological expertise, yet you cannot determine such a simple motive? My sides are liable to split at the absurdity.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What, and I supposed YOU know why?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Of course. Desecrating the body in that manner... indicates a strong sense of enmity on the part of the perpetrator.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that does make sense... It certainly paints a clear picture of the culprits intense feelings toward the victim.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Feelings of resentment over the theft of the soba shop deed, no doubt.

M-Me?!

You saw the karuta cards firsthand, did you not? Would you care to tell us about them in a bit more detail? Those tiny crime scene photos show us precious little of what I wish to know.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Well, those cards are from Shisho's special "Soba Scenes of Tokyo Past" set. Each card is related in some way to soba.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Spare me the history lesson! Just tell me how the cards looked at the scene, and no more!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Well, uh, there was soba broth spilled all over them...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That's not much help, I'm afraid. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, do you have a photo that shows the cards more clearly?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............I do. Please accept this meager offering, Your Honor.

Oh, my. What delightful-looking cards!

So the message "<span style="color:#E16935">WHET NO 4</span>"... was originally supposed to say "<span style="color:#E16935">OWEN 4TH</span>"! And this original message is our clue to the identity of the true culprit!

Heh! That indignant look on Prosecutor Sad Monk's face is positively priceless!

It wasn't "WHET NO 4"? Maybe the lawyer is smarter than we thought!

</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Karuta Cards updated in the Court Record.</span>

So now that that's settled... what does this "OWEN 4TH" mean?!

............Wait. Am I...?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Who else do you suppose is to provide an explanation?! Of course it's you!

Change the cards around all you'd like, but if you cannot explain what the message means... then it is as worthless as you are, defense!

</p><p>Athena:<br />

</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Still your thoughts for a second. There's a perfectly good witness to question over there.

</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. I'm afraid I have no idea who the devil this "OWEN 4TH" is, either. But the fact remains that the cards were rearranged to pin the blame on Mr. Whet. That in itself proves that the defendant isn't the real culprit.
</p><p>Athena:<br /> 
Prosecutor Blackquill is right! Besides, the important question here is not..."<span style="color:#E16935"> Who does the message point to?</span>" but rather..."<span style="color:#E16935">Who rearranged the cards?</span>"
</p><p>Blackquil:<br />
Tsk. Why didn't you point that out eariler if you already knew?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
S-Sorry. In any case, there were two opportunities for someone to rearrange the cards. The first was when Mr. Whet entered the dressing room...and the second was when Uendo discovered the body.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Are you accusing me of rearranging the cards? ME, who came to testify out of the goodness of my heart?!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Well, you didn't exactly come running out screaming straight away, did you? Even a mere two to three minutes is more than enough time to get up to some devilry. So what exactly were you doing in there, Uendo?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
*sip* *sip*
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Put down the tea, and spit out your answer!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Eep! M-Mr. Prosecutor! What's a guy supposed to do at a time like this?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
"Silence is more precious than diamonds," witness. Therefore, you need only remain silent. The defense is devious. They are waiting for you to make a slip of the tongue.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Oh, I see. So that's what you're after, is it? In that case...Your Honor, I've decided not to say another word.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Very good. After all, your right to remain silent is protected by law.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, Prosecutor Blackquill? Any other brilliant ideas you'd like to share?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha! Did you hear that, Cykes-dono? A rakugo artist who's afraid to speak! Who's ever heard of such a thing!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Are you trying to taunt him into talking? Such a petty trick will never work.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
That's right. I'm not going to fall for it.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I'm only asking to hear your story. Besides, is it not your job to tell tales if there is an audience to listen?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
E-Even so, I have a right to refuse to answer.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
The more you keep quiet, the more we want you to talk. That's simply human nature. Isn't that right, people of the gallery?!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
...........
</p><p>Blackquil:<br />
Even with this wonderful audience in front of you, you still refuse to talk? If so, then perhaps you chose the wrong line of work, my friend!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Are you saying I should quit?! Because I'm not afraid to speak my mind, I'm have you know. Oh, no! Never mind what I just said! It IS scary to talk! It's absolutely terrifying! But, no! As a rakugo artist, I must talk! If I don't, how can I ever show my face on stage again?! Your Honor, I'm ready to testify!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(H-He did it! He managed to convince Uendo with the power of suggestion technique!)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Bully for you, Uendo! That's as a REAL rakugo artist should be!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A-All right... If the witness wishes to testify, then by all means, please do.

What? Hmm... Let's see... Oh yeah! Now I remember! As I was going in, I whacked my little piggy on something. I was annoyed at my own clumsiness! Hee hee!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wait, you mean you stubbed your pinky toe?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
J-Just a little bump on my little piggy. N-N-No big deal... I-It's embarrassing, really...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Sounds more like he's hiding something. I'd better dig a bit deeper.)</span> No need to be embarrassed, Uendo, but I'm afraid it's something we need to look into. Hmm... I don't really see anything you could've stubbed your toe on... in the area around the dressing room door in this picture. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But maybe there WAS something there at the time...?)</span> Uendo, what exactly did you stub your toe on?

Hmm... Now that you mention it, I DO see traces of something getting dragged.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
And the drag mark ends... there at the <span style="color:#E16935">TV</span>. This implies that the TV was originally by the door. I'm convinced that this TV is the object the witness stubbed his toe on. Well, Uendo! How about it?!

</p><p>Uendo:<br />
O-Oh my! Yes, you're right! The TV hit the table, and Shisho's body moved with a jolt... That's when I first realized that Shisho was dead! Oh! But how scared I was!

"Out of control"? Care to explain how that's relevant?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You know how normally, I listen for the hidden emotions in a witness's voice, right? From there, I look for inconsistencies between their testimony and these emotions. But sometimes a person's feelings can run too high, making it hard to get a proper reading.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
So that's how your matrix program works. Fascinating!

</p><p>Blackuill:<br />

</p><p>Athena:<br />
I'll have to find the root cause of this tangled mess before I can treat him.

I'll need to point to what I think is the root cause, and touch "<span style="color:#E16935">Probe</span>" (X) again. Through this process, I can identify exactly what's causing Uendo so much distress!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
And that will help bring his emotions back under control? In that case, let's get started, shall we?

The dying message consists of two words: "<span style="color:#E16935">OWEN</span>" and "<span style="color:#E16935">4TH</span>." But neither of these two words have anything to do with this witness. This topic warrants no further argument.

</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Heh. Well, go on, then!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I can already tell this promises to be interesting. Now, please share your theory with the court, Ms. Cykes.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
There was something puzzling to me about Uendo's out-of-control emotions just now. Namely, that there are three distinct reactions present. I had never seen that before, and I wondered how it could be possible. 
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Is there a conclusion to this meandering musing of yours?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hold your horses, I'm getting there. So, could a person flip between three distinct emotions of such intensity like a switch? In the end, I concluded that it just wasn't possible. 
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Ha ha ha! So that's it, is it?! A bit unconventional, but I'll grant that it's possible within the realm of psychology.

</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Hey, you! Lawyer girl! You got a problem with us?! Huh?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
N-No... No problem at all...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This is all very hard to believe... but now that we've established that the witness has multiple personalities... could each of them please introduce themselves to this court?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Uendo Toneido. I'm a rakugo storyteller, as you know.

Yes, that's all of us.

So there are <span style="color:#E16935">three personalities</span> in total: Uendo, Patches, and Kisegawa, huh. ell, Simon! What do you think now?!

Hmph. That you're one lucky duck. Just be glad they were dense enough to help you out.

Argh! Can't you straight up say I did great for a change?

Heh. 
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You appear to be quite proud of yourself, defense...but all you have done is infringe upon the privacy of the witness.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I couldn't disagree more, Prosecutor! Now that we know there are <span style="color:#E16935">three personalities</span>...a new way for us to interpret the meaning of a <span style="color:#E16935">certain piece of evidence</span> has arisen.

<p>Judge:<br />
The karuta cards?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That's right, Your Honor. Recall the original dying message left at the scene. We didn't have a clue as to what "<span style="color:#E16935">OWEN 4TH</span>" could've possibly meant. But now, with this new information about Uendo and his personalities... isn't it possible that "<span style="color:#E16935">OWEN 4TH</span>" actually means... a secret <span style="color:#E16935">fourth personality</span> of Uendo's -- a personality named "<span style="color:#E16935">Owen</span>"?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Pohlkunka!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Uendo must have kept his dissociative identity disorder from us because... he didn't want to be associated in any way with that dying message!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
N-No! That's not why! We kept our disorder a secret for a diffrent reason altogether. 
</p><p>Patches:<br />
We've been taking advantage of our affliction to act out various rakugo characters. If word of this got out, well...
</p><p>Kisegawa:<br />
...our reputation as a rakugo artist would be tarnished, as would he Toneido name.
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
That's why we kept it a secret from evreyone except members of the Toneido School. But really, there is no "fourth personality." It's just the three of us in here. 
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
A plausible-enough sounding story...but it doesn't prove you didn't rearrange the cards, does it?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
B-But...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d8/SoJ_Satorha%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220420132507" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Satorha!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="SoJ Satorha!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Satorha%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/d/d8/SoJ_Satorha%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220420132507" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I will concede that it is highly likely that the witness rearranged the cards. 
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... actually agreeing with us...?)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
However, is it not also possible...that the accused killed Master Toneido...and then left that message in order to frame the witness?

Urngh!

And upon noticing the cards when he found the victim's body, Uendo rearranged them.

</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
A fantastic tale, but a tale none the less. No one outside the Toneido School knew about Uendo's multiple personalities. Uendo just finished saying so himself.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Ah, that is a true, but ultimately meaningless point. The witness was only in the dressing room for two to three minutes. That's far too little time to commit murder, wouldn't you say?

<p>Blackquill:<br />
Geiru escorted me to the dressing room...but we heard the sound of rakugo being performed from within. Thinking the master was rehearsing, we decided to wait in the hall until he was done.

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh, noooooooooooo...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I also heard that his rakugo performance that day was "a steaming pile of"... Well, you get the picture.

Y-Yes, I'm afraid so! Really stunk up the stage, I did! Hee hee!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />

Uendo was onstage before he found the body, so he could not have committed this crime. It is time to let it all go, defense, and move on.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Feh! Allow me to say this once more... Let it go, and move on.

</p><p>Athena;<br />
Never!

In that case, you must require another dose!

Not bloody likely!

Can you tell me which rakugo story you performed?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
I could, but I'm not sure if it would mean anything to the uninitiated.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
W-Well, even if I might not get it...can't you at least try me?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
All right. If you insist...The story I performed is called "Tokisoba" -- otherwise known as "<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>".
</p><p>Athena:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>", huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Maybe Uendo's right... He's only said the name of the routine, and I'm already lost.</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Ah... So you performed "<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>", did you?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What?! You know it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
In the course of my studies last night, I became familiar with a number of stories. I must say, defense, you would do well to prepare yourself better for your next trial.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Nnrrgh... Simon, what's "<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>" about?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. Look it up yourself.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Allow me to give an overview. The story takes place on a winter's night. A man orders a bowl of soba at a street stall. "How ya doin', sir? What can I get for ya?" "I see you've got seaweed-topped hanamaki soba, and mixed topping shippoku soba." "I'll have a bowl of shippoku, my good man. It sure is cold tonight, isn't it?" "But there's nothing like a hot bowl of noodles and soup to warm the soul!" "Ya know it, sir! One skippoku, comin' right up!" "So, how's business?" "Not so great, sir." "Is that so? Well, that's great, because things can only get better from here, right?"
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wow, Prosecutor!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The customer talks on and on like this. Finally, when he is done eating, he goes to pay for his soba. "So how much do I owe you?" "That'll be sixteen mon, sir." "I see... Sorry, but I only have small change on me." "I'll count the coins into your palm, so could you hold out your hand for me?" "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight..." "Hey, what time is it?" "It's nine, sir." "...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Thanks, and bye!"
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha! very well done, Prosecutor Sahdmaadhi! That was excellent!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Huh? I don't get it! What was so funny about that?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Tsk. Don't you see? The customer paid with coins, counting them out one by one. Then, just after counting "eight", he asked about the time...and the soba vendor answered with "nine."
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh! Now I get it! He made the vendor say "nine," and then he continued counting from "ten"!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Exactly. He cheated the soba vendor out of one mon with his smooth talking. The story continues with another man who saw the whole things and tries to do the same. But he bungles up the trick, and ends up paying more than sixteen mon for his soba. The story ends on that as the punch line. You can look up the rest of the details yourself. Or, I'm sure Prosecutor Sad Monk over there would love to perform it for you after court.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So, basically, it's a story about a man cheating on his soba bill! That's kind of petty, isn't it?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Hmph. Is that really ALL you have to say about this classic story? "Time Soba" is such a well-known staple of rakugo that the skill of the artist is critical in--

The story where a man cheats on his soba bill, right? Why do you think it didn't go over well?

Well... I suppose I was a little nervous... It's a lot of pressure when you're the star of such an important show, you know?

You? Nervous? I thought you'd be all calm and collected, but I guess even you can get stage fright, huh.

I wanted so badly to live up to the great name of "Uendo" that I inherited...that I guess I overperformed a little this time.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wait, "Uendo" was the stage name of a former member of the Toneido School, right?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
That's right. The name belonged to one of Shisho's former disciples who died of illness at a young age.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
With the weight of a new name like that to carry on your shoulders...I can see why you were feeling the heat -- just like me! I'm carrying the weight of my entire agency on my shoulders right now!

<p>Athena:<br />
This TV was used to view what was happening on the stage. Prosecutor Blackquill, when you came to the dressing room, what was Uendo doing? 
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
He was... performing "<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>"! Blast! Could it be...?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes. It could, and it was! What you and Geiru heard was NOT Master Toneido practicing his routine. It was Uendo's performance, as heard through this TV monitor's speakers!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Pyoooooooo!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
With the TV just inside the inner door of the dressing room...it could easily be heard from the hallway outside.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
And because we knew that Master Toneido was scheduled to perform "<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>"... ...we were easily manipulated into thinking he was still alive at the time, rehearsing!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes. Your knowledge of the day's program is why the two of you could be fooled this way. Simon, did the voice you hear belong to Master Toneido?
</p><p>Blakquill:<br />
Hmph. With the doors in the way, I couldn't tell exactly who the voice belonged to. But because I heard "<span style="color:#E16935">Time Soba</span>", I just assumed it was Master Toneido. I can't believe I was taken in by such a simple mind game.

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Uendo moved the TV back when he "discovered" the body. After all, he couldn't very well leave it by the door... ...because then someone might figure out the trick he'd been playing!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Ngh!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
And there's one more thing about Uendo's actions that's suspicious. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And that is...?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
The fact that he flopped so badly on such an important occasion.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What's so suspicious about that? Even pros slip up once in a while, you know.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But I believe that this time, it was intentional. Because Uendo knew it'd be strange to hear laughter coming from the dressing room!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, my!
</p><p>Patches:<br />
Yipes!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
It's all just a bit too perfect to be sheer coincidence! Plus, if the voice Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru heard was due to Uendo's scheming... then the victim's time of death could have been earlier than 4 PM! In other words, Uendo could have killed Master Toneido himself!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
PWOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
We've got you by the stones now, Uendo! So you'd better confess everything!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Ngh...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
We demand an explanation!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />

Uendo!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Nnngh... I-I confess. I-I tampered with the crime scene.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Is it the defense's claim that Uendo Toneido is the true murderer in this case?

If he tampered with the crime scene, then we have to at least consider him a suspect!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
If you suspect this witness, then I have a question for you.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What could it be this time?)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Uendo had absolutely no reason to murder Taifu Toneido. After all, why would Uendo kill the man who recognized his skills and promoted him?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
OH! W-Well... His motive... was, um... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't think of a single thing!)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It appears you are also not aware of one other fact. 
</p><p>Athena:<br />
A-And that is?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
That the accused visited the dressing room <span style="color:#E16935">before 4 PM</span> as well. Is it not natural, then, to suppose that the accused killed the victim at that time?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
WHAT? Nobody told me Mr. Whet had also gone there BEFORE 4 PM!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
We were only discussing the time frame after 4 PM, so I didn't think to mention it. But now that you have made the time period before 4 PM relevant...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
So, you really do not know what our client was doing during that time frame, do you? 
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, it was all very sudden, and, uh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why did you wait until the very last second to contact me, Simon?!)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Don't you give me that look! And just so you know, Bucky never told me he had visited the master before 4 PM, either.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Argh! This sort of thing is exactly why that prosecutor keeps calling us "unprepared"!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defense will stop squabbling this instant!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
S-Sorry, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, please continue.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Thank you, Your Honor. Defense. You know of the soba-making implements in the dressing room, correct?
</p><p>Athen:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is he talking about the equipment for making soba noodles?)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
You speak of the large bowl that is used to mix buckwheat flour and water... the long rolling pin, and the special knife that is used to cut the dough into noodles?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Precisely. These tools all came from the accused's soba shop. 
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You mean, they didn't belong to Master Toneido?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Mr. Whet had visited the dressing room to give the victim a soba-making lesson. And that visit was before 4 PM. I'm afraid that after the accused kneaded the dough and made those noodles... he committed the act of murder. 
</p><p>Athena:<br />
B-But wait! That doesn't add up! If Mr. Whet killed the victim before 4 PM, why would he return to that room at a later time?!
</p><p>???:<br />

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Uncooked noodles to stock up on?
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Yesh, ma'am. Master Toneido kept a supply of soba noodles from my shop in hish fridge. He only had one sherving left, so I went back t' my shop t' get some more. *hic*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(One serving of noodles in the fridge? But I thought the fridge was practically empty...? Hmm... Anyway, the whereabouts of the missing noodles isn't all that important now.)</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
You ran into me and Geiru when you came back to deliver the uncooked soba, correct?
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Dat'sh right, Simey! I made time outta my bust day to deliver him the noodlesh! And ya know what? He ignored me when I called to him from th' inner doorway! He just kept mumbling rakugo lines fer ages! So I got mad and went back to my soba shop!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I believe the accused's statement about going to the room at around 2 PM is true. For it falls within the the victim's estimated time of death.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That opens up the possibility that the crime was committed between 2 and 4 PM. That's some critical information! 
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes, Your Honor. But other than that one point, Mr. Whet's statements are dubious and without proof. 
</p><p>Athena:<br />

"Met," huh? Is that how you experience each other? Like people meeting on the street?

Well, it's more like all three of us are always here. And the personality that's most suited to the moment is the one that comes out.

I must agree -- you need to become more cultured, Athena.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Tomayto, tomahto. It's made of rice, and people get drunk from drinking it, right?

It's called "saké." End of story.

I recall Master Toneido would often have a drink or two before performing. He said it made him more eloquent. Drinking too much of the stuff can make one lose consciousness, though, of course.

</p><p>Kisegawa:<br />
I drank saké? Oh, that's a good one!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
We have a real sweet tooth, you see, so, yes, we did accept a sugary, red-bean bun...but since we really dislike saké, we said no, thank you to that.
</p><p>Patches:<br />
Believe it or not, we're real weak when it comes to booze. Hee hee! Even a tiny drop can knock us right out!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
So, you see... I had a sweet manju bun, but I didn't drink any saké.

What? But that can't be right! The defense demands that the glasses be examined right away!

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Since nobody involved with this case is named "Owen"... we have to explore the possibility that he's a hidden forth personality of yours. After all, the cards read "<span style="color:#E16935">OWEN 4TH</span>"!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
But how can you be so sure that that's what the cards really mean?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wh-What else could they possibly mean?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Well, for example, "Owen, the <span style="color:#E16935">fourth hitter</span>!"
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wh-Who in the world is that?
</p><p>Patches:<br />
He's a baseball player! A really great one, too! <span style="color:#E16935">Owen Gonzales</span>
, thirty-six years old. He's a "cleanup", <span style="color:#E16935">fourth-place hitter</span>, of course.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
If such a famous baseball player was there, hanging around in the theater... he would've drawn a lot of attention to himself, don't you think?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Well, then, how about this? (Patches) Maybe it means "<span style="color:#E16935">OWE N 4 TH</span>", like, "I owe 'N' four thousand."
</p><p>Athena:<br />
And who is this mysterious "N" person?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
What? "<span style="color:#E16935">N</span>" isn't a person! It was Shisho's favourite hobby shop, "<span style="color:#E16935">N-Joy</span>." He was a huge model train collector.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I-I see...
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Maybe he owed the hobby shop some money. So he left a note to remind himself.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
In karuta cards on a table?
</p><p>Kisegawa:<br />
Shisho worked in mysterious ways.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Are you even taking this seriously?!
</p><p>Kisegawa:<br />
I'm being completely serious! The point is, "<span style="color:#E16935">OWEN 4TH</span>" could mean just about anything!

So if you had even a tiny sip of saké, you'd conk right out, huh. That's why you didn't touch the glass that Master Toneido offered, correct?
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
Yes, that's right.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Then maybe you ate something that had saké in it as an ingredient?

I don't recall doing anything like that.

Well, yes... That's right.

The camel pattern... It's the same as the one for "Camel" brand <span style="color:#E16935">saké</span>!

</p><p>Athena:<br />
...but he DID eat some.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I-Impossible...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Uendo had a <span style="color:#E16935">"Camel" brand red-bean bun</span>... which boasts a nice shot of saké as one of its ingredients!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So the defense is claiming that Uendo passed out after consuming a "Camel" sweet bun... which allowed a fourth personality named "Owen" to emerge. Is that correct?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes, Your Honor! That's exactly what I'm claiming!
</p><p>Uendo:<br />
PYOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But there's one thing that bothers me. Wouldn't the alcoholic content of the buns evaporate as they are steamed?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
In order to give them a stronger flavor... some manju are specially made to retain as much of their alcoholic content as possible.
</p><p>Kisegawa:<br />

I'd hardly think a child like him could have a motive to murder the victim. And even if he had a motive, could he have actually committed the murder?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That's a very good point. Owen does appear to be very timid and weak.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oooooh...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It seems the defense was hoping this hidden personality would be the real killer. But now that he is standing here before us... it is clear that none of Uendo's personalities can be the killer!

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wh-Where can I even go from here!)</span>

</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Athena, do you sense anything behind his words?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I sense his sadness -- sadness so pure it's heartrending -- but no discord. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is right. Owen isn't the killer.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
But then, don't you find it odd?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Find what odd?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Let's review what we've learned so far. Uendo rearranged the karuta cards to pin the blame on Bucky.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, that's because the original message implicated Owen. But Owen is only five years old, and absolutely adores Master Toneido.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Exactly. The other three personalities also have no motive for murder. If Owen isn't the true culprit, then the person who first laid out the cards...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...Probably wouldn't have been Master Toneido! So then, who did it?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense? Did the appearance of Owen help you figure anything out?

Yes, Your Honor. I now know who it was that first laid out the cards.

Yes, let's hear the defense's reasoning. Please proceed, Ms. Cykes. But if you are bluffing, I won't go easy on you!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I understand, Your Honor. Now, then. Please recall the original crime scene. Who did the karuta cards name when the scene was discovered?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let's see... I believe they implicated the defendant, Bucky Whet.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That's right. But we then found out that the message originally read "OWEN 4TH."
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Which implicated the young boy, Owen.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Exactly. And the person who rearranged the cards was undoubtedly Uendo.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Uendo may have kept silent, but we can be sure he already knew his master was dead. His tampering with the crime scene using the TV all but proves it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Uendo:<br />
Nnngh... ...I-I confess. I-I tampered with the crime scene.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Blackquill:<br />
The reason Uendo rearranged the karuta cards and moved the TV was because... ...he saw the "OWEN 4TH" message, and was convinced Owen had committed the crime.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Right on, Prosecutor Blackquill! It would seem that Owen and the other three personalities don't share the same memories.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Uendo:<br />
But really, there is no "fourth personality." It's just the three of us in here.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Athena:<br />
Uendo feared that Owen had killed Master Toneido, so he tried to hide Owen from us.
</p><p>Owen:<br />
Ooohhh... *sniffle*
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
But it turns out, Owen is but a five-year-old child, incapable of hurting a fly... ...let alone his beloved master.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So naturally, the culprit must be somebody else. And this somebody else -- the true killer -- tried to pin the crime on Owen!

Hmm... I see. That does make sense.

Owen must've been lying on the floor when he witnessed his master's murder.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That's the conclusion I arrived at when I rotated my thinking by ninety degrees. Which means that all of the visuals in my matrix were off by ninety degrees.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And...?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
This means Master Toneido was also lying on the floor, which solves another mystery!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And which mystery is that?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
The mystery of how blood could've been dripping onto the victim's face. It becomes much easier to imagine how that could happen if he was lying down. Like, someone bleeding onto Master Toneido from somewhere up above him!
</p><p>Owen:<br />
I-I remember now! Somebody was sitting up on top of Shisho!

<center><b>NOISE LEVEL<br />70%</b></center>
<p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So trying to recall his master's bloody killer is what spooked Owen originally.)</span> The blood that stained the victim's face red came from the person sitting on top of him. The victim was holding a knife, so he likely nicked his attacker as he was fighting back!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
This means his assailant was injured on their face somewhere, like the forehead, perhaps?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Assuming the victim and his attacker were face-to-face, then, yes.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I see. So that is what happened. But if I recall correctly, the accused has a fresh bandage on his forehead, does he not? That injury of Mr. Whet's... ...is conclusive evidence that he committed this murder!

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!

Hmm... Owen, would you be all right with that?

That's funny...

What is it?

I still hear discord in Owen's voice... ...but I don't sense any inconsistencies between his statements and his emotions. And there don't seem to be any contradictions in his testimony itself, either.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Ahh, so that's it, huh?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Did you figure something out?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Your ability to sense emotions is making you focus too much on his feelings, Athena. But there's actually something he's being very <span style="color:#E16935">vague</span> about in his testimony. If you can clarify what he's feeling uncertain about with some evidence... ...you should be able to move forward from there.

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Huh? But why?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Because you appear to be suffering from severe memory loss, child. As I said earlier... ...the soba noodles would instantly fall apart if they were pressed into someone's face!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. Just like the defense's crumbling assertion!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I was kinda hoping you'd forget about the penalty, Your Honor...
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">Guess I'll give myoga ginger a try...</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Anyway, Your Honor, please let me try that again.

<p>Athena:<br />
The culprit must've used the soba before it was cut into noodles! In other words, the murder weapon was <span style="color:#E16935">raw soba dough</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order in the court! Yes, soba dough could definitely be used to suffocate someone, couldn't it!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............
</p><p>Athena:<br />
A-Are you all right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I was just letting the soul of the victim know... ...that the accused will finally face justice, thanks to the foolish lawyer before me.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Huh? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Allow me to summarize your statements. As the accused was killing the victim, he was slashed in the face by the victim's knife. The weapon he used to suffocate the victim with was the dough in the dressing room. He then disposed of the murder weapon by cutting the soba dough into noodles.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Agnrk! Why, you smarmy...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Afterwards, the accused put the victim's face into the bowl of soba noodles and broth... ...to wash off the blood that had dripped onto the victim's face from his own. And there you have it: the true sequence of events behind this foul affair.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
N-Now, wait just a minute! I never once said that Mr. Whet was the culprit!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Who but the accused knows how to cut dough into noodles, defense?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Gurk!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That's a very good point, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. I heard that cutting soba dough into uniform noodles requires considerable training. But then, what about the dying message? How do you explain that? The defendant wouldn't have known about Uendo's "Owen" personality.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Perhaps the victim was simply playing with the cards, and they hold no other meaning. Perhaps he spelled out Owen's name in jest, sometime before his murder.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's true. From Owen's testimony, it's clear that Master Toneido cared for the boy. Hmm... It appears we've arrived at a compelling conclusion. Taken together, all of these points paint a convincing picture of the defendant's guilt.

It seems Owen is now resting in the infirmary. They certainly have their hands full today down there. Let's continue with the trial.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Despite Owen's testimony, it is the opinion of this humble servant of the Holy Mother... ...that the child's words were insufficient to clear the accused of suspicion.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
B-But what about the scent of perfume Owen mentioned?! I believe it's a clue that will lead us to the true culprit!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... But there are thousands of perfumes in the world.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It could even be the scent of the hair product the accused uses.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He does have one amazing hairstyle, so that's certainly possible.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The witness is a five-year-old boy. He cannot tell the difference between conventional perfumes and hair products.

</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh man... How am I supposed to argue with that...?)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And so, the person Owen saw at the scene of the crime can only be... ...the accused, Bucky Whet!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(There's no reason for me to hold back! Not if I really believe in my client!)</span> The defense wishes to formally indict Geiru Toneido for the murder of Taifu Toneido!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I have tried to be merciful, but now, not even your pleas will reach the Holy Mother's ears! You will have plenty of time to regret your decision... in the pit of hell!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Except I won't need to! The person who murdered the victim was NOT Mr. Whet. It was Geiru Toneido!
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
That bandage is... It's just from a silly slipup I made while cooking yesterday, that's all!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What kind of "extreme cooking" were you doing to cut yourself on the forehead?!
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Well, what can I say? That's what happened!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You also don't have an alibi for the period before 4 PM, do you, Geiru?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
But... But... I really didn't know anything was wrong until Shisho was found dead! If you don't believe me, then, with a twisty, twist, twiiist! And BLOOOON! There you have it, an adorable little kitty! How could you suspect a cutesy widdle balloon artist like me, hmmmm?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Geiru, I've been meaning to say this for a while now, but... ...could it be that you don't have an eye for balloon art?!
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
D-Don't you think I know that?! You didn't have to come out and say it! I'm the daughter of a great rakugo artist! I never wanted to do stupid balloon art! I was supposed to be a rakugo storyteller, too, just like my late daddy. B-But Shisho told me to do balloon art instead... *sniffle*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess the victim thought she had no talent as a rakugo artist, either...)</span>
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
So you're still gonna suspect a poor, lil' thing like me?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
P-Please stop trying to skirt the issue! It all comes down to the scent of perfume, and the cut on your forehead! You and the culprit in Owen's testimony share these two traits!
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
You're dead set on accusing me, aren't you?! Well, here's what I have for naughty little girls like you! With a twisty, twist, twiiist! I'ma cut ya, witch! Go ahead, make me testify all ya want! When the truth's revealed... ...it'll be yer balloon or mine that goes POP! Got it?!

</p><p>Athena:<br />
A courtesy call after your performance, huh... Come to think of it, Uendo mentioned making the same kind of visit.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Yeah, a visit to yer master before and after yer routine... That's just common courtesy with us rakugo artists and entertainers.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So that means you paid the victim a courtesy call before your performance, too, right? What did you see at that time?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
He was having a drink and getting himself into a festive mood! He liked to say that drinking gave him a silver tongue.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So he was already drinking by then.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Uendo wasn't there in the dressing room yet at that time. He musta gone in there during my act, 'cause when I went back...

If Bucky had left that karuta message... ...he wouldn't have spelled out "Owen." He would've spelled out "Uendo."

What it boils down to is this: As a member of the Toneido School, you, Geiru Toneido... ...are the only one who could've left that "dying message"! And as the person who left that message... ...it's clear that you are Master Toneido's killer!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Silence, child. Playtime is over.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wh-What did you just say?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
As the witness stated, she went into the dressing room and soon came back out again. But the victim's note was not the only reason she left with such haste. There was another reason that compelled Geiru to leave at once. Geiru, would you please relate said reason to the court?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
There was a reason why Geiru <span style="color:#E16935">had to leave</span> the dressing room...?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Well, I didn't wanna show ya this, but I guess I got no choice. Keep yer eyes peeled! 'Cause here it comes!	
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Your hand is all swollen and red...! What happened, Geiru?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
If ya must know... I'm allergic to buckwheat!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Allergic reactions to buckwheat can vary, though they're usually on the severe side. With Taifu Toneido making soba noodles in his dressing room... ...Geiru is lucky to still be alive, considering all the soba flour that was swirling in the air.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Good thing I left pretty quick! I managed to escape with just a mild reaction. But I touched Shisho as he was being carried away, and look what it did to my poor hands! There musta been soba broth on his clothes or something. If I'd inhaled any of that soba flour, I'da had a seizure, and it'd been "Good night, Geiru!" I never coulda stayed in that dressing room for very long!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A person allergic to buckwheat couldn't be in a room with soba flour in the air... ...and certainly couldn't use soba dough as a murder weapon, either.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Th-This isn't good...
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
You knew it would come to this, didn't you?! That's why you never mentioned her allergy!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Hmph. As if I would do anything so underhanded. I was simply trying to protect the privacy of this witness.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
I'm sick of all these accusations! Why don't I just testify and get it all out in the open, yeah?

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Please recall Owen's eyewitness testimony, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. If the injury on Geiru's forehead was caused by the victim's knife... ...then Geiru's blood must've dripped down onto the dough used as the murder weapon! That would make the dough pretty conclusive evidence, wouldn't you agree?!

<hr />
<p>Geiru:<br />
*sniffle* Ooooh...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Are you ready to tell us everything now, Geiru?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
The whole reason... I entered the world of rakugo in the first place... ...was to follow in my father's wonderful footsteps, and inherit his stage name.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
His stage name...? You don't mean...
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">Uendo Toneido</span>"...
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
I knew I wasn't very good at storytelling, but I thought that... ...if I did the stupid balloon thing like Shisho wanted, I'd inherit the name someday. But Master Toneido gave the name to his junior disciple... Yeah... That's why I took my revenge on Shisho during the show celebrating the name succession.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So that... was your entire motive...?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
I doubt anybody else could understand, but... ...inheriting my father's name was everything to me. It was my whole reason for living.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Of all the days you could have taken your revenge... ...why did you choose the day of the show?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Because I wanted to pay Uendo back for stealing what was rightfully mine... I wanted to pin the blame on him at the show where all the Toneido fans were gathered...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But then, Uendo tried to shift the blame onto Bucky Whet... And now we know the whole story...
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
There's just one more thing I want to know. Did you know Master Toneido was making udon in his dressing room yesterday?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
No, I didn't. When I saw the soba-making tools, I was worried about my allergy... But it was my only chance to get my revenge on the two of 'em, so I went ahead and did it.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
So it was a premeditated crime, but in the end, you only went through with it on impulse. Then, the allergic reaction on your hand... Is it from touching the soba in the refrigerator with your bare hands... ...when you were tampering with the crime scene after your master's death?
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
Yeah... By that time, I wasn't clearheaded enough to worry about my allergy.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Geiru... How could you do all this, you idiot...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Geiru... ...I get your desire to inherit your father's name. But what you really should've inherited from him wasn't his name... ...but his heart.
</p><p>Geiru:<br />
H-His... heart...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Do you have anything to add, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Any objections?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...No, Your Honor.  ............Ms. Athena Cykes.
</p><p>Athena:<br />

</p><p>Bucky:<br />

Uendo said it was a spur-of-the-moment idea he got when he saw the soba-themed cards.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Simon! Where have you been?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I stopped in at Uendo's questioning. Only you, Bucky... could get framed for a crime on a whim.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
No way... I almost got convicted out of convenience...?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, at least you've been completely cleared of all charges, so... buck up, Bucky! On a more important note, what I really want to know is... ...why didn't Master Toneido let Geiru inherit her father's name?
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Wh-Whattaya mean, "on a more important note," Miz Chickadee?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Aww, don't be such a "Whet" blanket -- just go with the flow! Now, come on! You think the master was trying to encourage her to quit the entertainment business?
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
Naw, that's not it. He didn't give the name to her because he wanted Geiru to find her own calling in life... ...to perform whatever she wanted without being bound by her father's name or rakugo. Making udon was his way of showing his support for her in her new endeavor.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So that's why he called you to the theater, huh? To teach him how to make udon?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. A more roundabout way, I've never seen, but that's Master Toneido for you.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So this entire incident happened because of a misunderstanding? How sad...
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
By the way, Geiru wasn't the only person Master Toneido was trying to cheer on. Even though the person in question still seems unaware of the master's intentions.
</p><p>Bucky:<br />
What? You talking about me? Come on, no way! All that old man ever did was criticize my soba!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That's not true, Bucky... <span style="color:#0070C0">(There must be a way to make Bucky see just how much Master Toneido cared about him.)</span>

Ahhh... It's nice to see somebody giving it their all, isn't it? I wonder if I leveled up any thanks to this case.
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Don't kid yourself. The trial would've been a spectacle and a half had I not been by your side.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Y-You don't know that!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. For a lawyer who's versed in psychology, you're too full of weak points. You need to learn to analyze yourself more objectively.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Or, you could just teach me your famous mind tricks, Simon!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
No.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Way to shut someone down! And why not?!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Because the more pesky lawyers there are, the harder my job becomes. So it's in my best interest for you to remain green forever!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hey! What about what's in MY best interest, huh?! Besides, weren't YOU the one who had the wool pulled over your eyes by Uendo?!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Must you remind me?! How could I have known Uendo would do "Time Soba"?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hey, speaking of "Time Soba," I just thought of something funny!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Oh, goodie. I can't wait.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Okay, here it is. In "Time Soba"... ...why didn't mon number nine get counted? Come on. Do you know, Simon?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. How should I know?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Because... seven ate nine! Thank you, thank you! I'll be here all week!
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">ROTFL!</span>
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph! THAT, I should've known. Come on, let's go get soba or something and go home.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Your treat?
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
I'll treat you to 50% of the tab! And don't forget -- you still owe me for that manju!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Really, Simon? It wouldn't hurt for you to pay for me every once in a while, you know!
</p><p>Blackquill:<br />
Hmph. Quit squawking and start walking, Athena!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
H-Hey! Wait for meeeeee!
