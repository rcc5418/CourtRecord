The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band</div>
<p><i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
In a corner of that small, dark room, Sholmes and I waited with bated breath. In time, there came from the ventilator a hiss and a soft, almost growl-like sound. Suddenly, Sholmes sprang into action, lashing furiously with his cane at a point in the darkness. 'You see it, Wilson?' he yelled, his tense voice reverberating through the air. I raised my dark-lantern's shutter, and the room slowly came into view. Sholmes was staring intently at one particular corner when he started whispering to me, 'The victim's most perplexing final words - "the speckled band" - I believe this is the terrible coil to which she referred, Wilson!' In front of us was an enormous adder, its fangs bared as it threatened to strike. It truly was the most terrible 'speckled band' I had ever seen.

Detective:<br />
So then...let us unravel this mystery and discover what events led to this curious murder. Pray, do excuse me. The cabin door was bolted from the inside when the man was killed. No marks to suggest the bolt was tampered with in any way. So this would appear to be a locked room mystery. In his final moments, the victim scrawled a message on the floor. Hm, almost certainly with the ink from this upset bottle. A Russian word... So the victim was a Russian man, then. And the letters are well formed, suggesting he was compos mentis at the time. Hm, this is a most extraordinary script. And evidently...not penned by the same hand as this message. In fact, I deduce it was written by someone of a different nationality. This paper seal was placed just prior to the incident... by the victim himself, I would venture. Well... what have we here?
</p><p>Sailor 1:<br />
Who are you and WHAT do you think you are doing here?!
</p><p>Sailor 2:<br />
Da, da! No one must touch before maritime police come! We must wait!
</p><p>Detective:<br />
Shh! That won't be necessary. You see...in less than five seconds from now, I will reveal the killer to you. 
</p><p>Sailor 1:<br />
D-Don't be absurd! This is murder! And in cabin locked from inside!
</p><p>Detective:<br />
Ah yes, the locked room. But that mystery is paper thin. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You, you don't mean...the culprit is in there?!
</p><p>Sailor 3:<br />
Wh-Who are you and where have you come from?
</p><p>Detective:<br />
I'm a Great British consulting detective. The only one in the world. Herlock Sholmes. I presume...you must have heard of me.

Ah, the symbol of Yumei University... Every student wears this pin with pride. It's funny, but most emblems seem to be either round or rectangular. I like this spiked design, even though it doesn't really make any sense. Although, it does cause problems. Lots of students end up cutting their fingers on their badges. Perhaps it was the idea of one of the founders. 'A sharp pin for a sharp mind' or something...?

Of course, you can get a new pin made if you can just tell them your number. I've actually lost mine twice already, but I still don't know my student number by heart.

This is the paper seal I wrote for the wardrobe. I remember really working hard to make it. But I'll never forget how Kazuma reacted. 'Do you expect the Russian crew to be able to read that?!' he said. Still, I was sure people would get the idea, even if they couldn't read it. So we used it anyway. And it worked. I don't know if the crew thought it was creepy or what, but no one opened the doors!

You can see the remnants of the glue we used to stick this over the wardrobe doors. Although it wasn't proper glue, of course. We didn't have any of that with us. So I pulverised some rice into a paste to use instead. But to a stowaway like me, every single grain of rice represents precious rations. That's why I spread it as thinly as I possibly could. I couldn't bear to waste any.

</p><p>Sailor:<br />
We had to drag you out of the wardrobe. I do not believe how you could not wake up. You are true cold-blooded man. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You... Haah... You found me, then.
</p><p>Sailor:<br />
Da. We found you. And now you pay...<span style="color:#E16935">kriminal</span>! How long are you hiding in that tiny wardrobe, hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... Sorry... 
</p><p>Sailor:<br />
Now you have been found, it is time to admit your crimes. Unless you want to find out how cold the ocean is, hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no! I'll tell you everything!
</p><p>???:<br />
There's only one thing I'd like to know from you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Isn't that...?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Why did you do it? Why did you <span style="color:#E16935">take his life</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
M-Miss Susato! ......... Wait, what did you just say? 'Take...his life'...? 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um... Where, where is he? Where's <span style="color:#E16935">Kazuma</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sailor:<br />
Hah! You pretend you do not know?! You are a wolf in the sheep's pelt! You are <span style="color:#E16935">the killer</span>! Do not try to make excuses!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Kazuma-sama was... Kazuma-sama's <span style="color:#E16935">body</span> was discovered not long ago. Here...in this very cabin. That was bolted shut from the inside.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
His, his <span style="color:#E16935">body</span>...?
</p><p>Sailor:<br />
Please... ...do not try to tell us you were doing this terrible thing in your sleep!

Kazuma's <span style="color:#E16935">dead</span>...? But...he can't be... ......... And these <span style="color:#E16935">handcuffs</span>... Surely you don't think I...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I have to know... Why did you take Kazuma-sama's life? Answer me! Please!

<center>Kazuma... It was just two short weeks ago...</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Are you sure about this? Won't we get in trouble?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ha ha ha ha hah! Don't you find it fun being a stowaway? Besides, how else could you come to England with me to study?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was really something else when they brought your luggage in here earlier, though. The way that Russian crewman just tossed your travelling case onto the floor... ...I thought I was going to die!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, I still can't quite believe that. I really didn't think you'd be able to fit inside my trunk. You must be even less of a man than you look!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hey! Honestly, I thought I'd broken every bone in my body!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, it's about fifty days until we dock in Great Britain. But if you confine yourself to my cabin here, I don't expect anyone will discover you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, I hope not! I get the feeling those Russians wouldn't be very forgiving of a stowaway...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
They're a sturdy bunch, that's for sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What I want to know is, why do we need to keep it a secret from the young lady?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
From our faithful Judicial Assistant Mikotoba, you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
From YOUR close friend, more to the point. Surely we could confide in her, couldn't we? I don't believe she'd give me away.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No, but if she knew what we'd done, that would make her guilty by association. It's best that only you and I know about this.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm, I suppose so... 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Anyway, it's about the time that the steward is supposed to come and clean the cabin. I know it's cramped, but you'd better get in there, I think. It won't be for long. And anyway, compared to hiding inside my travelling case, it'll be a breeze. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, but what if the steward decides to open the wardrobe for some reason? Then I'll be in for it.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Stop worrying. I tell you what. Why don't you write 'Keep out' or something on this piece of paper?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then I can stick it over the wardrobe doors once you're inside.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't know...

We leave you at next port. Stay quiet until then. Don't make more trouble for yourself... ...Murderer!

No! I'm not a murderer!

Da! You said before! You said you admit everything about your crimes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! That's not right! I mean, yes, I did stow away on this ship, but... Murdering my best friend?
</p><p>Sailor:<br />
No one else could have done it. Admit the truth!

And these handcuffs... They think I did it? They think I'm Kazuma's <span style="color:#E16935">killer</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
When they found him, the cabin was <span style="color:#E16935">locked from the inside</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There's no access to the cabin via a porthole window, and the bolt on the door can't be operated from the outside. In other words, after the...crime, the culprit couldn't have escaped these four walls.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Or to put it another way, the culprit can only have been somebody <span style="color:#E16935">inside this cabin</span>. ...Or do you have some other explanation?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is impossible...)</span> How did he die, then? What happened exactly?

Are you still going to deny the charge? Even despite the circumstances?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(They don't know how he died?)</span>

The ship's doctor is examining the body, but of course, he has no post-mortem analysis experience. I don't suppose we shall learn more until an expert has been consulted at our next port of call.

So presumably that means...there were no obvious external signs of injury, then?

But I've never really thought about becoming a lawyer.

Yes, maybe. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But something's still <span style="color:#E16935">bothering me</span> a little. The look in his <span style="color:#E16935">eyes</span> then...

Oh, yes, it was. I remember clearly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I thought so. Kazuma always put it in place whenever I went to sleep in there. Just in case the cabin steward or another crew member decided to look inside. So naturally, he did the same <span style="color:#E16935">last night</span> as well.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! Yes, of course! The gentleman who discovered you peeled that <span style="color:#E16935">sign</span> from the wardrobe doors...before he opened them.

But if I were truly the culprit... ...I couldn't have climbed back inside the wardrobe and stuck this on the outside of the doors on my own.

Oh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, that's true at least.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But, but how...?
</p><p>???:<br />
'How the deuce did I know that?' perhaps? It was really a most elementary deduction. Hardly worth explaining.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Have you perhaps...managed to deduce anything else?
</p><p>???:<br />
But of course. A great many things. There is no mystery, my dear madam. For example... ...you have fled your native land of <span style="color:#E16935">Russia</span>, being, as you are, <span style="color:#E16935">a merciless revolutionary</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>???:<br />
You leave <span style="color:#E16935">sixteen</span> victims of <span style="color:#E16935">assassination</span> in your wake, and now travel to England to blow up <span style="color:#E16935">the Crystal Tower</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!!
</p><p>???:<br />
And! When the <span style="color:#E16935">beribboned</span> occupant of this very cabin discovered your identity, you <span style="color:#E16935">ended his life</span>, too! Yes...I believe that summarises the facts beautifully. No need to hide the truth now. Nothing deceives these eyes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Erm, just to be clear... You are talking about me, are you?
</p><p>???:<br />
Certainly I am. Do you see another in this cabin who fits the bill? A Russian assassin with sixteen victims to his name?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't even see ONE person who fits the bill!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />

</p><p>Susato:<br />
And, and you're plotting a revolution, too... It's shameful behavior, Naruhodo-san. Absolutely wicked!

For pity's sake, open your eyes! I'm not a Russian revolutionary! Obviously!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh... Forgive me...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And as for you! What kind of deduction was that?! You were just saying the first thing that came into your head!
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, but was I not right? Whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you do find yourself in a most troubling predicament...do you not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, yes, maybe.
</p><p>???:<br />
Hah! There you have it, you see! What do you make of that? Hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, to be honest... ...this ship is en route to England, and I'm in handcuffs at the scene of a murder. So...I'm not really sure you could call it 'deduction'. It's more plain '<span style="color:#E16935">observation</span>'.
</p><p>???:<br />
Indeed! And observation, my dear boy, is the basis of all deduction. My method is founded upon the observation of trifles, you see. I announce my findings with a brassy certitude... ...and more often than not, I'm right!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... I don't think you introduced yourself.
</p><p>???:<br />

Deduction, you see, is to me a science. Logical reasoning in its purest form.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A science...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The astute observer notices even the most subtle of reactions in his subject. A furtive glance, a twitch of a muscle...a slight inclination of the posture... Fingernails, arm sleeves, furrows in the skin... All these things are data!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Riiight...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And the trained logician makes deductions from this data in the blink of an eye. The ultimate conclusion is, without fail...the truth! ...As I demonstrated only a few short moments ago.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How can he look me in the eye and claim that...?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So you see...I have a turn both for observation and for deduction...and fame! THAT is what makes me the one and only Herr— No, Herlock Sholmes!

Have I managed to deduce anything? My dear fellow! Who do you suppose discovered the culprit in his most cunning hiding place? ...That's right! It was none other than the great detective before you now! Mr Herlock Sholmes!

When I became anxious about Kazuma-sama this morning... ...I summoned all of the crew members to force the cabin door open.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And I concealed myself among their number, gaining entry to the scene of the crime. Yes! Luckily for everyone, the great detective, Herlock Sholmes, was on board! ...And the handcuffs seem to be an excellent fit, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh!)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The very moment I laid eyes on the scene, two facts were immediately apparent to me.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes, tell us, please! What two facts were apparent to you when you came into this cabin this morning?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, yes... But first, let us be precise. The two facts in question were <span style="color:#E16935">immediately</span> apparent to me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, yes, I understand. But what were they?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Allow me to elucidate... The two facts that I deduced from a mere momentary glance at the scene of the crime were as follows: Number one: The cabin was <span style="color:#E16935">locked from within</span>, rendering escape of the culprit out of the question. Number two: The victim was <span style="color:#E16935">Russian</span> and killed following a dispute with an acquaintance.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hold on, Mr Sholmes! What made you think the victim was Russian?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Observe <span style="color:#E16935">the dying message</span> left by the victim on the floor. '<span style="color:#E16935">ГАРДЕРОБ</span>'... That is the Russian word for '<span style="color:#E16935">wardrobe</span>'.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Do, do you really think Kazuma-sama could have left a dying message in Russian?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In their final moments, many find their native tongue filling their head. For this young man, Russian.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma...was Russian, was he...?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Initially, I considered 'Garderob' may be the name of the killer. A certain 'Robert Garde' perhaps... But in the interests of thoroughness, I decided it would be wrong not to look inside the wardrobe there at least.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Where you found Mr Naruhodo sleeping soundly...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Quite so! I found you! The renowned Russian revolutionary killer!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why is that I'M Russian too?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I observed that you were wearing the same attire as the victim. In other words, you were acquainted. And if my memory serves, that outfit is the traditional dress of the Russian people.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Our school uniforms are the traditional dress of the Russian people? I, I had no idea!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...And I had no idea a detective could get something so wrong...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I took a photograph of the victim and the message, that I might analyse it for possible hidden details.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
This was taken immediately after the young man was discovered, before the body was removed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, Kazuma had already been taken away when I woke up. This is the first time I've actually seen him like this...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um... Yes...thank you.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Can I ask you something, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What, pray?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mentioned Russia before as well, didn't you? You know, when you said I was <span style="color:#E16935">a fearsome revolutionary</span> fleeing from <span style="color:#E16935">Russia</span> and all that.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, the train of reasoning that led me to the truth.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Would you mind explaining that train of reasoning to me, do you think?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">КОНЕЧНО</span>! Certainly, if it interests you.

Erm, can we talk about your deduction before? The things you concluded about me, I mean.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, the now famously accurate 'troubling predicament' you find yourself in?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Actually, it was the other details that I was more hoping to discuss. You know, the 'merciless Russian revolutionary and assassin of sixteen' part?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, the more sordid details. It was a fairly commonplace deduction. Here we have this morning's paper. The main headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. This vessel made a port call at Shanghai yesterday. And last night, the young Russian was murdered.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Since when was Kazuma a Russian?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It sounds like Mr Sholmes has concluded he was Russian because of what Kazuma-sama wrote on the floor.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was a simple act of reasoning to realise that the culprit of this crime was the same merciless revolutionary. One who would kill the very man who helped him to escape after his true identity was discovered! Yes, you...Vilen Borshevik!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no no! How could it be me? I don't look anything like this man! Just look at his face!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well...you are a fearsome revolutionary, after all. Therefore...you have no doubt learnt to revolutionise your appearance as well!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, please...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And, I might add, your name does not appear on the ship's passenger list. Need I say more?

</p><p>Susato:<br />
What about the other details? The sixteen victims of assassination and blowing up the Crystal Tower?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes. The journalist clearly interviewed the man and printed all those particulars in the article. The deeds the man has perpetrated thus far, and those he is plotting. Yes, everything about this revolutionary Borshevik was included. There can be no mistake.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Do, do revolutionaries usually agree to interviews with newspaper reporters, I wonder...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And what about the part where you said I was just returning from Afghanistan?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Also quite clearly stated here in the article. Borshevik is recently returned after a period of subversive activities in a war-torn region of Afghanistan.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Where even is it, anyway? This 'Afghanistan' place...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Here, take the paper for yourself. As a little memento of this great deduction.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...um, thank you.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I've absorbed all that is of interest to me within its pages. But I see no rubbish bin nearby.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The article about the revolutionary has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">On the back</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Cast your eye over it sometime if the interest takes you. Though you may need someone to interpret.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's all written in Russian. I couldn't hope to read it... But I suppose it wouldn't hurt just to glance at the article. Maybe there might be a picture or two...)</span>

You said the same earlier this morning, I think.

Indeed. But its uncommonness is so remarkable, I felt the need to say it anew. Yes, I do believe... ...these characters may be a crude attempt at a Japanese script.

Wha...?

Mr Naruhodo, I...don't like to be the one to tell you this, but... ...I think Mr Sholmes is trying to say that your handwriting is a little...untidy.

The pair of you floundering is a sorry sight. Allow me to offer some assistance. The article on the front page of this newspaper is concerned with a fearsome Russian revolutionary. It reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'

Allow me to give you a short summary of its contents.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Thank you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(He pops up everywhere, this 'Mr Sholmes'.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It's about <span style="color:#E16935">the disappearance</span> of a young lady last night. 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' During a performance in Shanghai, the famous dancer was reported missing. She is of course the talented, young <span style="color:#E16935">Nikolina Pavlova</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why are Russian names so hard to remember...?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear the woman was in costume when she was found to be missing from her dressing room... ...wearing the diamond tiara you see pictured, which is worth some twenty thousand roubles.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh. How much is twenty thousand roubles?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I have no idea! But I'm quite sure... ...it must be an unbelievable sum of money!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Susato-san's eyes are shining like diamonds themselves.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The tiara is the property of the Novavich Ballet. It would seem the director is beside herself with worry.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I'm not surprised.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The company is most anxious to recover both Miss Pavlova and the valuable tiara. They've requested international assistance at all ports with sailings to Great Britain.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Could this be another case of a Russian fleeing his or her country?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It does seem to be the Russian thing to do...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...I'm not even going to dignify that with a response, Mr Naruhodo.

...This article is about a dancer from a Russian ballet company who has disappeared for some reason.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, a prima ballerina called <span style="color:#E16935">Nikolina Pavlova</span>. She went missing from her dressing room whilst the company was performing in Shanghai. And the tiara she was wearing at the time appears to be a very valuable piece of jewellery.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Yes. I have no idea how much that really is, but... ...I feel sure you'd be given change from that amount even after buying all the cakes in the cake shop!

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So...I believe I've given you enough to consider for the time being at least.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, do you have somewhere to go?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As it happens, the victim's writings in his <span style="color:#E16935">diary</span> have piqued my interest. The matter warrants further investigation, I believe. ...And if I am still too long, the seasickness takes hold.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, I suppose... ...you're thinking of investigating the cabin next door, which the ventilator connects to?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Great detectives are a curious breed. Our minds rebel at stagnation. We crave mental exaltation. So yes, I intend to investigate. Hence the truth will become clear soon enough.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you think perhaps...! That we could go with you?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm...no, that would be somewhat complicated.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? But why?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A simple glance at your wrists should reveal the answer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh...these...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
After all, you're the prime suspect in this matter...no?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's no point trying to turn it into a question. You're the one who decided I was the culprit in the first place.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Whatever do you mean? I have no recollection of naming you as the culprit at any point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... You must be joking! You, you just said it! Only a moment ago!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Dear me, you are clearly misguided. I would have no cause to say such a thing.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well actually, Mr Sholmes... I did hear you say that, too.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You're quite sure? ...Well, that's very strange. I wouldn't have said you had the face of a criminal, you know? ...Not...really.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So what, were you looking at my knees before? Some great detective you are...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well anyway. That was then and this is now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What I mean, sir, is this: If you are the culprit, then you must play the part more convincingly! Roll over and accept your fate! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now he's just being plain rude. And off he goes, having just laughed in my face... His sense of humour's as twisted as his name...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Naruhodo-san! What are you just standing there for?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We must go and investigate the cabin next door as well!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Aren't you forgetting something? What about these? There's no way I can-
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Haiiiiiii-YA! After Kazuma-sama spent his dying moments struggling to leave us a clue, you're willing to give up?! You're just going to roll over and accept your fate?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(As if you gave me any choice in the rolling over part...)</span> I think we still have some investigation to finish off in here first, don't we? Let's carry on examining what we can in this cabin while we wait for a chance to slip next door.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Good idea! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The situation doesn't look good for me, but there are still things I can do to help myself. And I owe it to Kazuma to do everything I can to find a way out of this...and bring the real culprit to justice!)</span>

We're doing what we can to investigate Kazuma's death ourselves.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I thought you might be. You didn't do it, did you? You're not the killer?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course not!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We'd really like to investigate the cabin next door.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, so we need to be allowed out of this cabin!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... I'm sorry.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
You've been deemed a risk to the ship's safety. If you moved to even touch the handle of the cabin door... That stormy-looking seaman there would surely snap your neck in two.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose...I'm not just a stowaway now. They think I'm a murderer as well.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... Would it be possible... ...to give me something to work with, do you think? I'm going to need <span style="color:#E16935">something persuasive</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
If I had a solid reason why the next-door cabin should be investigated, for example... ...I'd do everything I could to persuade the captain to allow it. Really, I'd lay my life on the line if I had to.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...I don't see how...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... There may be a way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! Really?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Think of how you tried to persuade me of your innocence, Naruhodo-san. By <span style="color:#E16935">presenting</span> me with a piece of evidence that you already had in your possession.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Evidence...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's just the same as when you are in court. You must have done it many times during your trial. Simply select the '<span style="color:olive"><b>Present</b></span>' panel... ...and choose some evidence that Inspector Hosonaga could use.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So...evidence that would give us a viable <span style="color:#E16935">reason</span> to investigate the next-door cabin, is it?)</span> ...Alright, yes.

Right. A reason why it's so important that we're allowed to investigate the next-door cabin.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Exactly.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There's only one way to do that. It's very similar to the situation you had with me before, Naruhodo-san. You need to present some evidence to the detective.

Just before he died, Kazuma-sama wrote something rather strange in his diary.

Strange? In what way?

He wrote, 'What looks like some kind of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'

Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Whew, I'm finally out of that cabin...)</span> I have to admit, this isn't quite what I was expecting. It's less spacious out here than I thought it would be. And this is the most luxurious accommodation...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, indeed. Kazuma-sama was being sent on this study tour by the government. That's why he was being put up in <span style="color:#E16935">a first-class cabin</span>. Even still, this is about twice as large as my accommodation in steerage.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? That must be awful. Oh! Look over there! That's another crewman keeping watch. And he looks enormous! Even if he is sitting down!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The door next to him leads to the second-class accommodation. I suppose he's making sure that no one comes in here who shouldn't.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Like people in handcuffs?)</span>

Naruhodo-san, you look like a little boy visiting a toy shop for the first time. I would have thought you'd be used to the ship by now. We've been at sea for two weeks already.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well yes, I know. But the thing is... ...I was inside Kazuma's trunk when I first came aboard. And ever since then I've been shut up inside that little wardrobe.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...It must have been a very trying time for you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

I'm not sure that 'rough and ready' is much of a compliment, Naruhodo-san. Even to a sailor. Anyway, last night's log is mostly blank.

This looks like a plan of the SS Burya. It shows each deck, look.

The Burya is a large-scale steamship with a triple-skinned hull. What a marvel of engineering!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well it's been playing on my mind for a while now, actually, but... How is it that such a huge lump of metal doesn't just sink to the bottom of the ocean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, that's really quite simple, Naruhodo-san.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It is?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well...consider the Japanese archipelago.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The islands of Japan?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. They're not metal, but they are enormous lumps of earth, many, many times larger than this ship. And they don't sink, do they? They've been floating happily on the sea since the gods created them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I suppose so...

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There can be no other explanation that accommodates all the facts. Mr Roylott... I have reached <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> incontrovertible conclusions.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
What, what do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Number one! Your <span style="color:#E16935">true identity</span>...is that of <span style="color:#E16935">a villain</span>! Using those shears, you are about to end the existence of something most dear. ...Are you not?
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
Huh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And number two! The other conclusion I have drawn... You are...at this very moment no less, in the midst of committing a most grievous <span style="color:#E16935">crime</span>! Beneath that beard, your mouth quivers with nervous tension as you realise you have been discovered! ...Does it not?
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Naruhodo-san! I never imagined I would witness one of Mr Sholmes's <span style="color:#E16935">great deductions</span> with my own eyes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That...was a great deduction?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Nothing can deceive Mr Sholmes! In a single glance, he can <span style="color:#E16935">deduce all there is to know</span> about a person!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What ineffable twaddle!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, I've read about it countless times in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. ...And now I've experienced the astonishing impact of his great deduction firsthand! This is like a dream come true!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I can hardly believe it, but...all the colour has drained from Mr Roylott's face! It looks like somehow, both of Mr Sholmes's conclusions... were <span style="color:#E16935">right</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
How...? How could you...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'How could I possibly know such things?' you wish to say? Very well then, I shall elucidate. I shall explain how it was that I arrived at this pair of conclusions. So do I cordially invite you upon a journey of logical discovery! Let us board the train of reasoning! ...Put plainly, let us work through my deductions together.

<b>The Great Deduction</b><br />The game is afoot!</center>
<p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Old Man's Identity
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So, the dubious-looking Russian, Mr Roylott... Obviously, what catches the eye in the first place... ...is the enormous pair of <span style="color:#E16935">shears</span> in your hand! Now, we ask ourselves, what could you possibly want with such an implement? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face. You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>copious beard</b></span>  you sport! Now, moving on... The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of this magnificent beard, Mr Roylott? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear evidence to shed light on the matter.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Regard, if you will, this morning's <span style="color:#E16935">newspaper</span>. In particular, the fascinating front-page article. Which, it would appear, you have read also, Mr Roylott. I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>article about the revolutionary</b></span>! In translation, the headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. As you cannot fail to observe, the subject of the article possesses an extremely copious beard. Having noted the article yourself, you decided to remove your incriminating facial hair before it gave you away. In short, your <span style="color:#E16935">true identity</span> is beyond doubt. You are the fearsome Russian revolutionary himself, <span style="color:#E16935">Vilen Borshevik</span>! ...Not that I've heard of you myself, you understand.
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Old Man's Identity
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
A revolutionary on the run
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Wrongdoing
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And <span style="color:#E16935">the proof</span> of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Mr Roylott... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>travelling case</b></span>! It is time, I think, that the case be opened and its contents laid bare.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
No! I refuse!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What could you possibly be concealing inside, we ask? By my estimation... ...<span style="color:#E16935">a young lady</span>, perhaps. One slight enough to fit therein.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
D-Don't be absurd!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And what, pray, would be the identity of this young lady in the travelling case? Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find <span style="color:#E16935">the answer</span>. Yes, the reason you refuse to open your travelling case can equally be found in the pages of this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>newspaper</b></span>. For there is another, most stimulating article... ...if we turn from the fleeing revolutionary... to <span style="color:#E16935">the back page</span>! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' Such a headline can lead us to but one conclusion. Your crime...is that of <span style="color:#E16935">abduction</span>! And according to the article, the young lady's name is Nikolina Pavlova. 
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />

</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Kidnapping of a young ballerina
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's <span style="color:#E16935">great deduction</span>...of this Russian enigma! ...Elementski!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Susato-san... That wasn't one of <span style="color:#E16935">the great deductions</span> I've been hearing so much about...was it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, um...the stories are full of Mr Sholmes's brilliant deductions, you know. But that...did seem <span style="color:#E16935">a little different</span> somehow...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Excuse me, Mr Sholmes! Could you come over here a moment?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Pray, what can I do for you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's about your deductions. Would you mind?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not at all. Go on.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, to start with, there's the newspaper article. I think we had the same discussion before, but... ...these two men look nothing like each other!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, I recall our discussion earlier. And at the time, I believe I told you... ...that the man is a revolutionary. Well able to revolutionise his own appearance.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In fairness to Mr Sholmes, Mr Roylott does look more like this man than you do.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...not the point. And another thing! The part about him abducting the ballerina...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. A truly startling revelation. At first glance, the case would appear too small to accommodate a young woman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not just at first glance! It IS too small! Clearly! You'd be lucky to fit a <span style="color:#E16935">five-year-old</span> child into that case! Even if you pushed really hard!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I don't suppose the missing ballerina is a five-year-old child, is she?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You mean you don't know? No, the young lady is <span style="color:#E16935">fifteen</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I didn't know. How could I?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Hm... Well, if she's fifteen, then ten years' worth of her would be poking out from the case...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Some years ago, I read something pertinent, I believe. A troupe of men consuming vinegar daily in order to promote a certain litheness in their bodies.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Vinegar?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For such a sour bunch, it would surely be simplicity itself to contort oneself into the confines of that small case.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear. You might be thinking of contortionists in the circus, Mr Sholmes...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh, this whole thing is turning into a circus...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, something's occurred to me about Mr Sholmes's deductions just now... I think his powers of observation are, well...magical! His eyes cut to <span style="color:#E16935">the heart of a matter</span> almost instantly. It's just...where he directs his <span style="color:#E16935">attention</span> and his <span style="color:#E16935">logic</span> that seem a little...off.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your idea of 'a little' may be a little off itself, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's just one or two <span style="color:#E16935">key words</span> in his deductions that seem to let him down. So I was wondering if we might perhaps tactfully <span style="color:#E16935">switch</span> them for alternatives. What do you think?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm... Switch some <span style="color:#E16935">key words</span> in his deductions...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, but very tactfully. I feel sure if we could do that... ...we'd unlock the true genius of Mr Sholmes's great deduction!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely the thought that was going through my own mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This man is a lot of work...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
At times, I wonder how anyone puts up with me! Ah ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's not that funny...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, and you, my good fellow...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Take a moment to look at your wrists.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My wrists?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! Wh-Where are your handcuffs?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?! How, how did...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I felt they may hinder your ability to follow me in our... dance of deduction.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't believe it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes, you are a marvel!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And don't worry. I shall restore the shackles to your wrists when we are finished.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm not worried. In fact, I'd rather stay like this...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I doubt that's something I'll ever have to worry about. It doesn't quite sit right with me, though.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It doesn't seem to be sitting right with Mr Roylott, either.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Which means, I suppose, that the deduction is <span style="color:#E16935">wrong</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's try to <span style="color:#E16935">switch</span> a key word here, Naruhodo-san, and see if it helps matters.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright. But how?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think we should start by taking a long, hard look at Mr Roylott.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I wonder if it's really his beard that he intended to use those shears on...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Exactly. If we do manage to find something that seems to fit the sense of Mr Sholmes's deduction better...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then what?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Then I'll leave the rest in your capable hands, Naruhodo-san!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why am I the one to do something about this...?)</span> Well anyway, let's see if there's anything we could even use to switch around in that last sentence. What exactly was Mr Roylott really going to use those enormous shears for?

For years, you have been on the run in your homeland. And that hat has never left your head. As a result - almost unbelievably - your thick beard has woven itself inextricably together with your hat. But now you have an itch! Somehow you must reach it. Even if it means cutting the hat off!

The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of these magnificent locks? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> to shed light on the matter.
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>article about the revolutionary</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, that was a shock! I had no idea that old man was really a young woman in disguise! Did you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Why are you staring at me like that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Yes, it was a surprise. Naruhodo-san... You're enjoying this, aren't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You look like you're in your element as you dance around the room deducing the facts with Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm just doing what we agreed. I'm, I'm not having fun or anything! This is strictly business! Not strictly come-
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, yes, I understand. Say no more.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well anyway, let's focus on this next part of Mr Sholmes's deduction, shall we? <span style="color:#E16935">The evidence</span> that he's picked out doesn't fit the facts at all.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No, that's true, given that Mr Roylott is actually a woman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly. He - or rather she - can't possibly be this <span style="color:#E16935">merciless revolutionary</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I suppose it's because the deduction as a whole has taken a different direction now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's switch the evidence for something else. Something that fits the facts as we now understand them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(For some reason, this <span style="color:#E16935">woman</span> needed to try to hide her true identity. I feel as though I've either read or heard about <span style="color:#E16935">a young woman</span> in a situation like that recently...)</span> Alright, I'll do my best!

<p>The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>article about the revolutionary</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Roylott isn't a merciless revolutionary at all.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No. He isn't even a 'mister'. Under that disguise, 'he' is a young woman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And I do feel like we have some evidence here somewhere that might reveal who she really is.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's have another look through all the evidence we've gathered so far and see if we can find it!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The evidence that reveals your true identity is of course...<span style="color:#0070C0"><b>the article about the ballerina</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That's right. You've hit the nail on the head! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' It would appear we are finally able to address you by your true name.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, because your true identity is that of the Novavich Ballet's prima ballerina...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Miss Nikolina Pavlova!
</p><p>Roylott:<br />
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! .........
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...You're right. My real name is Nina. I mean, <span style="color:#E16935">Nikolina Pavlova</span>. But please, I beg you... Don't tell anyone!

Kidnapping of a young ballerina
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And <span style="color:#E16935">the proof</span> of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Miss Pavlova... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>travelling case</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This woman is the ballerina. And she's right in front of our eyes. So clearly she can't be inside that travelling case as well.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No, that's right. It seems she wasn't abducted at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In which case...what is <span style="color:#E16935">the crime</span> this young woman is apparently committing? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Haah, I can see I'm going to have to step in and fix the great detective's mistake again...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You seem to look pleased, Naruhodo-san. Do you like the idea of another chance to dance around with Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Stop it. Anyway, there must be something else here that shows what this woman is up to!

Crime comes in so many different forms, that's the thing. How can we be sure...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes's observational skills are beyond question, Naruhodo-san. Miss Pavlova definitely let her eyes stray to something. And that something will explain everything. We must look around very carefully, and try to work out what she was looking at.

Alright, I'll investigate the area more thoroughly. I agree that there must be something here that will prove what this woman is really guilty of.

Ah!

I believe this tiara is worn on stage by dancers in the Novavich Ballet, is it not? Indeed, it would appear to be identical to the tiara pictured here in this newspaper article.

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Come come, let us not be hasty!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There remains one unsolved <span style="color:#E16935">mystery</span> about you.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Mystery? Wh-What do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You have staunchly <span style="color:#E16935">refused</span> to open this travelling case of yours in our presence. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that there exists <span style="color:#E16935">some reason</span> why you wish it to remain closed. Is that not so...Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Um...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear girl, there is no sense in playing games with me. Nothing escapes my attention. Indeed, I have a very good idea of <span style="color:#E16935">the contents</span> of your case, even before I have ever laid eyes on them. Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find the answer. Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>books on the shelf</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He's completely changed tack with his deduction now!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think Mr Sholmes is adapting his logic to the changing circumstances, don't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Maybe, but why has he suddenly brought the bookshelf into all this? It's just a wild guess, surely!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh... Do you think so?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, it doesn't seem likely that the reason why this young woman doesn't want to open her case... ...would have been written in a book that doesn't even belong to her!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's true. But still... Miss Pavlova certainly did cast her eyes in that direction. I noticed it myself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then there has to be another reason why she won't open her case. And it must be somewhere in the same area, if that's where her <span style="color:#E16935">gaze</span> was involuntarily drawn.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I agree. That's the only answer.

It's a metal door, the same as in Kazuma's cabin.

Yes, and the rather slim bolt is the same as well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, if Miss Pavlova was actually glancing over at the door here instead of the bookcase... ...that would suggest a desire to run away from this cabin.

Hm, maybe...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The way I see it, books are the treasured collection of all human knowledge. There's almost nothing you can't look up in a book. Which means we can probably look up the reason why Miss Pavlova won't open her case in one, too!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.

An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.

<p>Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>books on the shelf</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Surely the reason that Miss Pavlova doesn't want to open her travelling case... ...is because there's something inside that she doesn't want us to see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it must be what's inside... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Come to think of it... ...we saw the case moving before, didn't we?)</span>

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Inside that case of yours, is something <span style="color:#E16935">forbidden</span> from carriage on this vessel. That is the real reason why you refuse to open it, thus revealing its contents.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As we've seen, the trunk wobbles from time to time. But no weapon or other dangerous item would move of its own accord.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />

<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So clearly, you aren't who you said you were.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
No. I am not <span style="color:#E16935">Grimesby Roylott</span>. My real name is <span style="color:#E16935">Nikolina Pavlova</span>. Everything you said was correct.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You absconded during one of your ballet company's performances in order to escape your homeland. Later that same night, you stole aboard this vessel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Which couldn't have been easy. The Burya is a huge steamship with a vast crew. Could she really have snuck on board without being noticed?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In order to obscure your true identity, you somewhat recklessly took the guise of an old gentleman. And you intended to sever all links with your past by severing your long hair.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yet to a woman, hair is no trifling matter. My personal recommendation is to leave well alone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...if it was just you, about to cut off your own hair... ...who was it that let out <span style="color:#E16935">the scream</span> we heard from outside the cabin?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That veritable tinkling of a bell? Why, none other than this young lady, naturally.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(More like a full set of pipes, if you ask me...)</span>
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I was so scared when I ran away in Shanghai. I was sure they would come looking for me. That's why I decided to... How do you say? Disgust myself? So no one would recognise me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
As a result, you transformed yourself into that questionable old man? I see...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I put on the fur hat and...fake beard? Then, just before you came in here, I saw in the newspaper. Right on the page...there was a picture of me. I was so frightened. I couldn't stop from screaming. I knew that if I didn't change my appearances completely, they would find me. So I decided to cut all my hair as fastly as possible. I picked up the scissors in my hand, and...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...At that precise moment, we walked in through the annoyingly unlocked cabin door.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Things happen like that sometimes, don't they?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Things do indeed happen like that from time to time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Are those two even talking about the same thing?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There's just one more thing I'd like to know... What exactly do you have inside your travelling case?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... You were right. It is my <span style="color:#E16935">dear friend</span> inside. My only friend in the whole world. Please...don't tell anyone! If the captain finds out... If you say to any of the crew...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your secret is safe with us, I assure you. But in return... ...you must tell us, in as much detail as you can muster, about the events of last night.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...Yes, alright. I will tell you.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, Mr Naruhodo...? Wasn't it something, Mr Sholmes's great deduction?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was certainly something, yes. I'm just not entirely sure what... But at least Miss Pavlova has agreed to tell us what she knows. That's incredible!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed! It IS incredible! Ah, and one more thing...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...yes? What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Observe your wrists.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! Your hands...are cuffed again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAT?! But, but how...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
True to my word, I have restored your shackles.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Grrr... <span style="color:#0070C0">(When? And why?!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There is still a shadow of guilt cast over you, Mr Naruhodo. I'm sorry to say...it can't be helped at the moment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Can't it? Really?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Anyway, let's listen to what Miss Pavlova has to say. I can't go on not knowing... I have to find out what the 'speckled band' that Kazuma-sama wrote about in his diary really was!

Miss Pavlova, allow me to pose you a riddle.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
According to this newspaper, it was only yesterday that you absconded from the ballet. Now, that being the case... ...it must have been last night that you boarded this vessel.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
However... ...the SS Burya stopped by no port last night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! That's it! Of course!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So how is it, pray, that you come to be aboard?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Now that I think about it, the crewman outside the cabin acted very strangely when we mentioned that. It was just after we asked him about when the occupant of this cabin came aboard...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Strogenov:<br />
......... That is not your business.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, you're right. He did seem to be hiding something.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... ......... 'An angel descended from the heavens, bringing grace and beauty to the stage.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What was that?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
It is how the Russian newspapers described one of my performances. And that is how I came here, too. I descended from the heavens. Because I am an angel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Considering English isn't your mother tongue, your description is very vivid.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes once said, 'I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.' It seems Miss Pavlova is the same.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'A genius descended from the heavens, bringing grace and beauty to detection!' ...Words once said about myself. A quote from a wonderfully extravagant advertisement for 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' in fact!

Miss Pavlova, about this article... Did you know about this merciless revolutionary already?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
No. But when I saw the picture, I couldn't believe it! He looked just like me in my disguise!

Huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Am I the only one around here with eyes?)</span>
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
The other man - the one wearing the brown - he also said so. He said we looked the same.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, he says a lot of things. But I have a strong feeling that besides you and the 'great' detective... ...you won't find another soul on this ocean who thinks there's any similarity there at all.

Mr Naruhodo! I won't allow you to speak ill of Mr Sholmes!

No no! I wouldn't dream of it!

This is the diary of my friend who passed away.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
His diary?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, and he wrote in it last night before he died. Something a little unusual. It reads: '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint <span style="color:#E16935">whistling</span> sound.' And then a few minutes later: '1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of <span style="color:#E16935">speckled band</span> is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
A speckled band? I...don't understand...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's strange, isn't it? But the ventilator he mentions joins to this cabin, you see. It's up there on the wall.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In other words, this cabin and the victim's cabin are <span style="color:#E16935">connected together</span>.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Miss Pavlova...? Has something occurred to you? Does <span style="color:#E16935">the speckled band</span> the victim mentioned mean something to you? Or <span style="color:#E16935">the whistling sound</span>, perhaps?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... No. I don't know anything.

</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />

</p><p>Susato:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What is it, Susato-san?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well... ...Kazuma-sama was wearing leather shoes with a very <span style="color:#E16935">dark tan</span> hue.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dark tan...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(A sort of dark brownish-<span style="color:#E16935">red</span> then...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, a little like the colour of red wine, but darker. I often repaired them for him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Does this mean...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(...that this <span style="color:#E16935">mark</span> was made by the polish on Kazuma's shoes as they scuffed on the floor?)</span>

Mr Sholmes... ...you seemed to be examining something before we interrupted you.

Ah, yes. That. I was immersed in study of <span style="color:#E16935">the ship's log</span>, as penned by the stockily-built crewman who's usually on guard here.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, the ship's log.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And did you find out anything useful from it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, after 2 a.m. this morning, the majority of the entries are <span style="color:#E16935">blank</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which means that there was nothing to report. Nothing of note happened, so-
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are a student from the Land of the Rising Sun! You've been utterly blinded by it! Ah ha ha!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your logic, my boys, is inverted.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Observe the other pages, and all shall become clear. It would seem the same crewman oft stands sentry in this first-class passageway. And he has an almost religious practice of recording '<span style="color:#E16935">Nothing to report</span>' every half hour.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, he writes that in every thirty minutes?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Nothing to report...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely! Put simply, the seaman writes 'Nothing to report' when there is just that. And yet...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...The ship's log from last night is largely <span style="color:#E16935">blank</span>. He didn't even write 'Nothing to report'...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Do you mean...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes. There were circumstances afoot last night, which led to the seaman being absent from his post.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What kind of circumstances? What happened?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That remains a mystery for now. But we can be sure something significant took place. So significant, that it caused the seaman to forget his regular habit of scribing 'Nothing to report' in the log. These are important details. I would stake my life on it! You must log the ship's log in your mental file!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The ship's log has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now THAT deduction was worthy of a great detective.)</span>

Ah, you're starting to understand what 'my way' is, I see. What makes Sholmes 'Sholmes'. ...Brilliance! Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha...hah. ...Ooh. Ouch.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? I'm right here, yes. Why?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, good. I thought you might have climbed into the wardrobe when I wasn't looking. There's no place like home.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Believe me, I don't have some strange compulsion to jump inside every wardrobe I see, you know.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well anyway, I'm not sure anyone could fit inside this one. It's full of beautiful outfits. I suppose they're all stage costumes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm... I was rather hoping we might find Miss Pavlova's 'friend' hiding in there, but no such luck.

Yes. Although what a fool a shipbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room.

Somehow, the door to the cabin we were in ended up bolted after we made an emergency stop. Susato-san took a deep breath, then gently slid back the bolt...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
You! What are you doing in Miss Pavlova's quarters?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah, you both look unhurt. Good.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, we're fine, thank you. What on earth happened? We heard something about how we were going to collide with another ship!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes. It appears to have been <span style="color:#E16935">a false report</span>, though.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, how did that happen?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
There's a dense fog outside, so it's extremely difficult to see. Someone must have thought he saw a ship ahead. This person obviously triggered the alarm and that's why we made an emergency stop.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Everything is chaos! Passengers are screaming! Crew are running everywhere!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
This first-class area is the only quiet part of the ship at the moment.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, I see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Someone <span style="color:#E16935">triggered the alarm</span>? Does that mean...? ...that someone pressed <span style="color:#E16935">that button</span> outside?)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? No no! We didn't touch it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right, Miss Pavlova. It was already open when we came into your cabin.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Inspector!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Um...yes?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Arrest this man! I know he did it! He is <span style="color:#E16935">a criminal</span>! Is it not enough that he has killed a man?!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Da! And he is stowaway as well! If vixen promises not to steal chicken, do you believe?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />

Wait! A cell...?

Please, Inspector Hosonaga! Is there nothing you can do?

This is a Russian vessel. I really have no jurisdiction here. After my last effort to appeal to the captain's good nature, I think I'm out of options.

What the...? What are you doing up there...? ...MR SHOLMES?!

Naturally, I was analysing what a weight of twenty thousand roubles feels like on one's head. Have I not told you that as a detective, it is my business to know what other people do not? This isn't mere tomfoolery, my boy! Oh no no!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well...why were you hanging from that hook before then?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Isn't it obvious? To properly assess the weight of the twenty thousand roubles, naturally. I wished to determine if it would bend that conceited-looking hook on the wall, so full of brag and bounce!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Agh, I never know whether to take this man seriously or not!)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah, you again! The 'great detective'!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, Inspector! I confess I've been looking for you. I have something to report to you most urgently.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Well, you might try looking for me somewhere other than a hook on the wall next time.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What is to report? Speak!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
An urgent report from a great detective can mean but one thing... Yes... The case of the curious murder that took place last night, here on this vessel, the Steamship Burya... ...has been <span style="color:#E16935">solved</span>! By me, naturally.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Really?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, I have eliminated all other possibilities. No other explanations exist! So, allow me to illuminate all your minds! For I am about to reveal my great detective's greatly admired great deduction to the case!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Hah! You have solved it? Even hedgehog understands this case! We all knew who was responsible for killing student boy this morning, when we found kriminal in wardrobe! It is this stowaway! And he has handcuffs to prove it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I didn't do it!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The trouble is, there doesn't appear to be anyone else who could have killed the victim. Because, as everyone knows, the cabin door was bolted shut from the inside. That means the culprit must be someone who was inside the cabin.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, it's what's called <span style="color:#E16935">a locked room mystery</span> in detective stories.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Da! Locked room! That is point!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
The room...was locked...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well I can't deny that. There's no way the bolt could have been drawn across from outside the cabin.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You are all quite mistaken. The cabin next door is not a so-called 'locked room' at all.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh yes. There is another <span style="color:#E16935">entrance</span>. <span style="color:#E16935">An entrance</span> used last night by the culprit in order to gain access to the cabin despite the bolted door.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What <span style="color:#E16935">other entrance</span>? We never discovered one!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why, it gapes open-mouthed at you even as we speak! ...<span style="color:#E16935">The ventilator</span>, man!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The ventilator</span>?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Gah ha ha ha hah! You think this is funny?! I cannot even put my arm through that hole!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's...because your arms are as thick as tree trunks.)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
You're suggesting that the culprit entered and left the victim's cabin through that tiny opening? It's not possible!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, but it is. And last night, the victim even <span style="color:#E16935">witnessed</span> the intruder in the act of passing through the ventilator.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes, do you mean...? Are you referring to the words Kazuma-sama wrote in his diary? '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint <span style="color:#E16935">whistling</span> sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of <span style="color:#E16935">speckled band</span> is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely, my dear madam.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But what does it mean? What is this 'speckled band'?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The answer</span> to that particular conundrum... is in this very cabin.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
M-Mr Sholmes? What are you doing?

There is a distinct element of danger. But fear not; I am ready! What I am about to expose for you all to see will shock you to your cores! Behold!

Well, that snake...isn't really '<span style="color:#E16935">speckled</span>', is it? It looks more...<span style="color:#E16935">stripy</span>...wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, you're right. I think in this case, you'd have to call it... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the striped band</span>...wouldn't you?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Heh heh heh... You both see, and observe. With distinction! However... ...do you not think that is precisely <span style="color:#E16935">the trap</span> into which the culprit wishes you to fall?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my goodness, really? It's, it's a trap?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How exactly...?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I think perhaps it is time I explained the intricacies of my train of thought. Are you ready...Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I'm sorry for the young man who died. But that is all. His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There are two conclusions I have drawn from the facts. Number one... Last night, your 'friend' infiltrated the victim's cabin!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And number two... That same <span style="color:#E16935">friend</span> was responsible for the victim losing his life!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
No...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's turned as white as a bowl of rice again... Sholmes must be right! He's <span style="color:#E16935">hit the nail on the head</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
This young woman's 'friend'...? Killed Mr Asogi...?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
.........! .........? .........!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like he can't speak with that snake coiled around his head.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I would advise as little moment as possible, Seaman. You wouldn't want the fangs of that long friend in your neck. So, everyone...let us begin! Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his '<span style="color:#E16935">Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</span>'!
</p>
<hr />
<center>
<b>The Great Deduction</b><br />The game is afoot!</center>
<p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Intruder's Identity
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Miss Pavlova, moments ago you claimed the following: 'His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!' Yet you cannot deceive yourself! Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your <span style="color:#E16935"><b>aching heart</b></span> smarts with pain! And it is that very pain...that <span style="color:#E16935">evidences</span> your inextricable link to the victim's death. So, we ask...what was the nature of this intruder that stole into the victim's cabin on that portentous night. Why naturally, it was the '<span style="color:#E16935">friend</span>' with which you boarded this vessel, was it not? Ah... As I suspected... Another telltale <span style="color:#E16935">glance</span>. Without doubt, your 'friend' is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>writhing serpent</b></span> we see before us! And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of '<span style="color:#E16935">a speckled band</span>'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>snake's sloughed skin</b></span>! Evidently, after the subtle and horrible crime, this most deadly friend of yours... ...<span style="color:#E16935">shed its original skin</span>. No?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I, I don't know what you are talking about!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Last night, through the ventilator visible in this cabin, your then speckled friend slithered next door. Using the bell cord on the other side as a bridge, the serpent silently descended into the victim's quarters. In the dim light, it appeared to the young gentleman who was about to lose his life as a speckled band.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In summary, the nature of this '<span style="color:#E16935">friend</span>' of yours, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a rare breed of snake whose markings change each time it sloughs its skin! A snake so dreadful, we can only imagine it would be found in the deepest depths of India.
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Intruder's Identity
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
A beloved speckled snake
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
How Mr Asogi Died
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a <span style="color:#E16935"><b>terrible venom</b></span>! Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> to affirm it at the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Oh no! Could there be...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes! An examination of the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>deceased's body</b></span> will prove the cause of death conclusively! The almost - but not quite - imperceptible puncture wounds left by <span style="color:#E16935">the venomous fangs</span> will seal the truth. Yes, <span style="color:#E16935">the vestiges</span> of the snakebite delivered by your terrifying friend.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
This, this makes no sense!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There is no point feigning ignorance, Miss Pavlova. ...After the incident, you endeavoured to hide everything, didn't you? But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>travelling case</b></span>! When we first met in this cabin, it came to my attention that your case moved periodically. Your serpent assassin was restless inside, no doubt.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
You, you don't...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It is telling that the victim made note of a low <span style="color:#E16935">whistling</span> sound that he heard minutes before his end. That was your <span style="color:#E16935">signal</span>, was it not? The sound you had used to train your serpent friend.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
To...train...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed, you'd put the serpent through this ventilator and wait. After a period, you'd summon it back with a whistle. You couldn't know if the animal had done its duty, so you would listen for signs of life next door. If the victim appeared not to have been dispatched, you'd release the snake once more. Do you deny this snake has undergone such training?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
It's not true!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Having slithered through the ventilator and down the bell cord, the creature needed only to sink its fangs in once... ...and its venom would course through the victim's veins, ending his existence forever. That is <span style="color:#E16935">the true nature</span> of <span style="color:#E16935">the speckled band</span> that took the poor young man's life! There can be no doubt! My logic is infallible!
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />
How Mr Asogi Died
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Death by a venomous snake's bite
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's <span style="color:#E16935">great deduction</span> of the speckled band!
</p>
<hr />
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:<br />
Miss Pavlova has trained her pet snake as <span style="color:#E16935">a killing machine</span>. There on the floor, you will observe a saucer of milk. The promise of food is the key to training any creature.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In-Incredible! You've <span style="color:#E16935">solved</span> the mystery!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Amazing! Your <span style="color:#E16935">great deduction</span> really lives up to its name! I see now why Herlock Sholmes has become such a household name!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear man... It was nothing remarkable. As the Russians say, 'I could have done it with one left hand.'
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Um... Could I venture an opinion, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But of course. What's on your mind?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's just, about your deductions before... Some things don't quite make sense to me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I welcome questions as to my method. And will answer both loudly and proudly!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh. Well, good. First of all... ...snakes are egg-laying creatures. Part of the <span style="color:#E16935">reptile</span> family.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You are well informed, madam.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And reptiles, um...<span style="color:#E16935">don't drink</span> milk.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's really only mammals that like to drink milk, you see. So...I'm not sure it would be possible to train a snake using milk as a reward.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
No matter! No doubt Miss Pavlova used some other treat to encourage her pet to do her bidding. Milk was merely an example. The logic holds.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, there is something else. Snakes have no <span style="color:#E16935">ears</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, so I'm not sure it would really be possible to signal to a snake by whistling...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But madam! What of the tales from Arabia? Have you not heard of the snakes that dance to the sounds of a flute?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think perhaps the performers play their music in time with the snakes' natural movements...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh. I see. No hands, no feet, no EARS?! These creatures are so inept as to be practically useless!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Don't take it out on the snakes, Mr Sholmes!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Um...there is one other thing....
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You have more?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Snakes use the scales on their bellies to propel themselves. So...I'm not really sure that a snake could manage to climb up a flat bell cord like the ones in these cabins.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then it should try harder!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Please, don't be angry with me, Mr Sholmes. The point is... ...even if the snake had gone through the ventilator to the next-door cabin, it couldn't have come back without help. What I'm trying to say... ...is that there are a number of reasons why it's <span style="color:#E16935">difficult</span> to imagine the snake could have had a part in this.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think... ...we need to step in and help again, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh no, you don't mean...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. We need to modify Mr Sholmes's latest deductions, and turn them into the great ones they ought to be!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I had a feeling that was coming.)</span> Alright...let's give it a try!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Just what I was waiting for, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes... Right!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So, cast your eyes down to your wrists again.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? You've done it again!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Your handcuffs are gone!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Where did they go?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Fear not. I shall see they're restored after our work is done.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I really wish you'd leave them off...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />

Yes, that's true. She looks as though Kazuma-sama's death is weighing heavily on her mind.

But you're not sure Mr Sholmes has read her quite correctly, is that it? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Could there be some other way to <span style="color:#E16935">interpret</span> her expression, then?)</span>

Yes, when you recall those horrid events, that <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>claw scratch</b></span> smarts with pain!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed! And simple observation reveals...that the wound is fresh.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Pavlova, did you in fact receive that scratch... ...sometime last night?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah! ......... When I think about the young man who died next door, I feel so sad. And when I am sad...the pain from this wound is worse.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And it is that very pain...that <span style="color:#E16935">evidences</span> your inextricable link to the victim's death.

No, they don't. They don't even have hands or feet on which claws might grow.

We can be reasonably sure that Miss Pavlova's furtive glance was aimed at her friend.

AAAGH! ......... Darka is my best friend. I couldn't leave her behind.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, Darka would appear to be a Russian Blue. And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of 'a speckled band'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!

My dear boy, there can be only one answer to that.

How Mr Asogi Died
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Death by a venomous snake's bite
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a <span style="color:#E16935"><b>terrible venom</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What Mr Sholmes says is true. There no signs of <span style="color:#E16935">a wound</span> anywhere on Kazuma-sama's body.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. But Mr Sholmes seems to be unaware of one very important detail. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma wasn't <span style="color:#E16935">poisoned</span>.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, it would seem so. Let's give him the information he's missing now!

In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>post-mortem report</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, yes! I knew it was one or the other!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...! His neck was...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. The breaking of the cervical vertebrae is fatal. Only that goliath would be strong enough to survive that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Seaman Strogenov isn't some immortal freak, you know...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The jury is out. Anyway, we have on good authority that the victim's neck was broken. Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> to affirm it at the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Oh no! Could there be...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes! An examination of the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>deceased's body</b></span> will prove the cause of death conclusively!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma died because his neck was broken. In other words, he was probably struck by something... or someone.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's a distinct possibility. As of yet, no weapon has been found, though.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Presumably Darka didn't silently creep up behind Kazuma and deal him a fatal blow...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I suppose... ...it's possible that he had <span style="color:#E16935">a fall</span> and hit the ground awkwardly. It could have been a terrible act of misfortune that he broke his neck completely by accident.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh yes. <span style="color:#0070C0">(A bad <span style="color:#E16935">fall</span> could explain it...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's rather hard to believe of Kazuma-sama, though. He wasn't a clumsy man.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm... Well, we need to fix this deduction somehow. Is there anything from the scene that could explain what happened?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma died because of a broken neck. Either he was struck by something...or he fell badly and it happened by accident.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There was something we found in his cabin that puzzled us, if you remember? A strange mark. It should be among the other evidence we've gathered.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, let me look through the evidence again for the strange mark Susato-san's talking about.)</span> Could that mark explain what happened...?

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! An examination of the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>mark on the floor</b></span> will prove the cause of death conclusively!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
This particular mark, so prominently visible next to the victim's body, is a deposit of <span style="color:#E16935">shoe polish</span>.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Shoe polish?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. Positively identified by a little analysis device I constructed, which I carry now as a matter of course. Beeswax, tallow and dye were my results. The undeniable ingredients of shoe polish.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And the colour of the polish is a perfect match to the colour of Mr Asogi's <span style="color:#E16935">laced leather shoes</span>.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Looking at this mark, it's not hard to imagine what happened. For some reason... ...Mr Asogi must have caught his foot at that point on the floor and <span style="color:#E16935">tripped</span>.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Please no...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And, by a dreadful turn of misfortune, caught his neck against some immovable object as he fell to the floor. Suffering a fatal blow to the spine, the victim's vertebrae shattered, and in that instant...he lost his life.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
NOOOOOOOOO!!! ......... I don't know... I don't know anything about this!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is that really true, Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What about <span style="color:#E16935">the evidence</span> left at the scene where Mr Asogi lost his life?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the facts are as clear as day to me! You did all you could to conceal the incriminating evidence. But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>travelling case</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I, I don't believe it! Kazuma-sama merely tripped over and...and now he's no more? It can't be true! I refuse to accept it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And if this part of Mr Sholmes's deduction is right... ...Miss Pavlova is trying to hide some <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> that would prove it. Here in this cabin...somewhere in the direction that she just cast her eyes.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Where, I wonder?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Let's have a good look around. The answer must be here somewhere!

No, it was that little kitten she calls Darka. Not that it's anywhere to be seen now. It seems to have let itself out of the case and gone exploring.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I think... Yes! This is the evidence!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ahem! My dear fellow, that evidence... ...deserves one of Miss Pavlova's trademark dismissals, I would say. Would you do the honours, young lady?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I...don't know...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Perhaps you would care to propose some other piece of evidence. The answer is really quite simple. But then, there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If you look at this photograph, you can clearly see... ...hanging from Darka's collar... ...the very glass bell in question!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The truth has caught up with you, Miss Pavlova. The young man who lost his life last night did so after a truly inauspicious fall.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And the cause of that fateful stumble?
</p><p>Your absent feline friend...Darka!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... ......... I couldn't... I couldn't tell anyone... ...I'm...sorry...

<span style="color:#E16935">Death by tripping over a cat</span>

<center><span style="color:red"><b>Solved</b></span>
<p><br />
</p>
<b>Deduction Complete</b><br />Elementary!</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why don't you tell us now, Miss Pavlova? Tell us exactly what happened last night.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... It was...a little after one in the morning. It was so late, but I hadn't had time to feed Darka. So I gave her some food. And then, all of a sudden, she scratched me and jumped out of my hands.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
People do say that cats become very anxious and nervous in new environments.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
She was so fast. She disappeared through the ventilator before I could stop her.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And that is how you <span style="color:#E16935">acquired the rather nasty wound</span> on the back of your hand, I take it?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Yes. And I had read the, um...rules on the wall. I knew that I was not allowed Darka with me.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes, modern science suggests that animals can carry infectious diseases. It's a precaution really.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
So I listened and listened, trying to hear if there was some noise in the next cabin. It was very quiet. I was sure, if someone was there, he must be sleeping.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So at that point, you thought it safe to try to lure the kitten back again? By dangling the end of the toy through the ventilator and into the adjourning cabin.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Darka always loves this toy. But it didn't work. Nothing worked. I tried using her favourite toy, I tried whistling to her softly, but nothing... She didn't return.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the '<span style="color:#E16935">faint whistling</span>' sound Kazuma wrote about in his diary was Miss Pavlova, trying to <span style="color:#E16935">retrieve her pet</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Cats have a propensity to remain hidden in the shadows when frightened.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Yes. So there was nothing else I could do. I just had to wait until she had calmed down. But then...
</p>
<hr />
<center>MIAOOOOOW!<br />
*Thud*</center>
<hr />
<p>Pavlova:<br />
I, I nearly passed out with shock. I heard her cry out, and then... Oh, it was such a dreadful bang! Then afterwards, nothing. It was totally silent.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma was...)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... From the appearance of the brown mark on the floor... ...it seems likely that what you heard was the victim stepping on the glass <span style="color:#E16935">bell</span> and tripping up. The SS Burya is a large vessel, but even she can pitch and roll violently without warning. If Mr Asogi was already off balance as a result of the ship lurching when the kitten got under his feet... ...the combination of unfortunate factors could easily have caused him to <span style="color:#E16935">fall over</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But what became of the kitten afterwards?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... In the end, I managed to get her to come back through the ventilator.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yet Darka is nowhere to be seen.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I...must have forgotten to lock my case. And now she's disappeared again.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Gracious, that cat is as insufferably restless as I am!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, he knows something about himself, at least...)</span>
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
When I woke this morning, I heard that a young man in the cabin next to mine had died. But I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone what had happened. I was too scared. Scared that they would send me back.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Hold on a minute... What about <span style="color:#E16935">the snake</span>?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
You're right! Where is it?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If the snake isn't your friend, Miss Pavlova, then whose is it, and where did it come from? What on earth is such a dangerous creature doing on board this ship?!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Oh. I didn't say? Snake is my friend. His name is <span style="color:#E16935">Pirozhko</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm...?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAAAT?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That snake belongs to you?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
He escaped from cage when emergency alarm sounded. I was looking for him. I did not expect to find him in here!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, how did that snake get into this cabin?)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But... ...animals are not permitted on board!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Hah! We are at sea for ONE YEAR! You want to be so long without close friend? Without someone who understands?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Couldn't you find someone a little more...human who understands you better?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But my dear burly fellow... ...a gargantuan venomous snake?! Surely you can appreciate the danger you're putting everyone in?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
No venom.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Pirozhko does not have venom. He is harmless! Very long, but very gentle! He is adorable, like Granny!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It's...venomless?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Yes. Now he is hungry, so he is in bad mood. But once I feed him, you will see big smile!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...you feed him...what? Milk, I suppose?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Hah! Like they say they milk chickens? ...Ridiculous! Snakes that drink milk are only in stupid stories! Pirozhko eats mouses! Big, fat, round mouses!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah... Oh, so... ...is that what <span style="color:#E16935">the mousetrap</span> in the passageway out there is for?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Of course. How else can I catch my friend's favourite food?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Nothing says 'top of the food chain' like the look in their eyes right now...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... It refuses to drink milk, it can't hear a whistle, it can't climb up a bell cord and it's not even venomous... How the deuce did <span style="color:#E16935">something so inept</span> land a starring role?!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Is not my fault! I do not make up stories! My Pirozhko is nothing to do with this incident!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's what happened... That's the truth behind my best friend's tragic death...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Miss Pavlova...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I understand the difficult situation you've found yourself in. And I do sympathise. But please remember this: A young man lost his life. If you're going to attempt to cover up your <span style="color:#E16935">guilt</span> with lies, then... ...then no matter what the circumstances, I cannot forgive you!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
But...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What are you talking about, Miss Mikotoba? What lies? Miss Pavlova just confessed everything! It was just a series of unfortunate events. <span style="color:#E16935">An accident</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm no great detective like Mr Sholmes. I don't have a gift for knowing the truth. But even I can see...<span style="color:#E16935">that was not the truth</span>! Don't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(To be perfectly honest, yes. There's <span style="color:#E16935">a discrepancy</span> in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure of it. I just can't quite put my finger on it.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... I confess... ...I was intending to let Scotland Yard deal with any outstanding issues on this matter.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I am only present here for a very specific reason. The truth is, you, Mr Naruhodo, are simply <span style="color:#E16935">a distraction</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A distraction?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I do hope you've not been finding your <span style="color:#E16935">shackles</span> too uncomfortable.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Not again! When did he do that?!)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Especially as they're on your wrists as a result of my intervention. I was rather hoping I could resolve matters before we made our next port call.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You were, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, but I overlooked one important detail. The deceased young man was a very close <span style="color:#E16935">companion</span> of yours... ...was he not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes. Kazuma was my closest friend. I owed him my freedom, even.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In that case, we must follow this to its conclusion. No further <span style="color:#E16935">distractions</span>. You must uncover the REAL truth here, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes... Whatever that may be... <span style="color:#0070C0">(The key to this is <span style="color:#E16935">the discrepancy</span> in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure. If I can <span style="color:#E16935">chase that down</span>, maybe the truth will become clear. The truth about how you really died. About how that <span style="color:#E16935">scene</span> in your cabin really came to be...!)</span> Alright. I'll see what I can do.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Excellent.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Thank you, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So then, shall we begin?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What we should ponder first... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">the victim</span> who lost his life in a cabin that was bolted shut from the inside. Was this truly an unfortunate <span style="color:#E16935">accident</span>? Or was it in fact no <span style="color:#E16935">accident</span> at all? That is what we must establish in the first instance.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But we've already established it, haven't we? The man tripped over the kitten that had climbed into his cabin via the ventilator. Tragic, yes. But still <span style="color:#E16935">an accident</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait! Let's just take a step back. It doesn't make sense if that's really what happened, does it?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I'm going to have to ask you to spell it out for me, I'm afraid.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.)</span> <span style="color:#E16935">The evidence</span> is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable! His death couldn't possibly have been a mere <span style="color:#E16935">accident</span>!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
R-Really?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Let us show our hand, Mr Naruhodo! Time to present <span style="color:#E16935">the evidence</span>! <span style="color:green">The evidence that proves unequivocally that the victim's death was no mere accident!</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The truth is clearly <span style="color:#E16935">recorded</span> in this photographic print! There's <span style="color:#E16935">no way</span> that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That script... It's <span style="color:#E16935">Russian</span>, isn't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it is. The word written means '<span style="color:#E16935">wardrobe</span>'.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I see what you mean. Most people would leave a dying message in their native language. <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese</span> in this case.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
But, but maybe he was studying Russian! It is a simple language. He, he could have picked it up very fast!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That doesn't seem likely.)</span> That's actually not the point. It makes no difference whether he knew Russian or not.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Sorry? What do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly what I said before: There is <span style="color:#E16935">no way</span> that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor. And the reason why is clearly explained in here: 'Damage to the cervical vertebrae resulting in instant death.' ...<span style="color:#E16935">Instant death</span>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which means...after the victim fell to the floor, he couldn't possibly have written anything. Because he was already dead!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's not the only reason, either. There's something else we found in Mr Asogi's cabin. <span style="color:#E16935">A remnant</span> of something that couldn't possibly have been there, if what Miss Pavlova told us was true!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So, Susato-san has noticed it too, then...)</span> Putting this <span style="color:#E16935">message</span> on the floor aside, there's something else that gives the truth away. <span style="color:green">Another piece of evidence that proves this was no accident!

What point are you trying to make with that evidence?

I'm starting to see how Kazuma's death really happened! ...I think.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...'I think'...that you are starting to see nothing of the sort! And that was the evidence to prove it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If it was no accident, then what we should be looking for is one of two things: Either the absence of something you would expect to find at the scene of an accident... ...or the presence of something you wouldn't.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Most compendiously put, my dear madam!

If that's really what happened... ...then how did one half of <span style="color:#E16935">the bell</span> end up back here in <span style="color:#E16935">this cabin</span>?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, remember that we found the other half of the glass bell in that <span style="color:#E16935">wastepaper basket</span>. Would you care to explain that...Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Oh no...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's not the only reason, either. There's something else we found in Mr Asogi's cabin. <span style="color:#E16935">A remnant</span> of something that couldn't possibly have been there, if what Miss Pavlova told us was true!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What?!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(So, Susato-san has noticed it too, then...)</span> Putting <span style="color:#E16935">the piece of glass</span> aside, there's something else that gives the truth away. <span style="color:green">Another piece of evidence that proves this was no accident!

What point are you trying to make with that evidence?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm starting to see how Kazuma's death really happened! ...I think.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...'I think'...that you are starting to see nothing of the sort! And that was the evidence to prove it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If it was no accident, then what we should be looking for is one of two things: Either the absence of something you would expect to find at the scene of an accident... ...or the presence of something you wouldn't.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Most compendiously put, my dear madam!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...I see...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, I confess your rather languid 'I see' doesn't fill me with confidence, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo, I believe in you! ...Well, more than Mr Sholmes does, anyway.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.)</span> <span style="color:#E16935">The evidence</span> is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The truth is clearly <span style="color:#E16935">recorded</span> in this photographic print! There's <span style="color:#E16935">no way</span> that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That script... It's <span style="color:#E16935">Russian</span>, isn't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it is. The word written means '<span style="color:#E16935">wardrobe</span>'.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I see what you mean. Most people would leave a dying message in their native language. <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese</span> in this case.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
But, but maybe he was studying Russian! It is a simple language. He, he could have picked it up very fast!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That doesn't seem likely.)</span> That's actually not the point. It makes no difference whether he knew Russian or not.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Sorry? What do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly what I said before: There is <span style="color:#E16935">no way</span> that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor. And the reason why is clearly explained in here: 'Damage to the cervical vertebrae resulting in instant death.' ...<span style="color:#E16935">Instant death</span>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which means...after the victim fell to the floor, he couldn't possibly have written anything. Because he was already dead!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........!

</p><p>???:<br />
You are wasting time!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Someone else</span> was there? Da! Of course! We know this!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Bulkhead was bolted shut from inside. There was <span style="color:#E16935">no way in or out</span>!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Oh yes...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
And only other person in cabin when young student died...was <span style="color:#E16935">you</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a> 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's true, I was in the cabin when it happened.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You were <span style="color:#E16935">shut inside the cabin's wardrobe</span>, to be precise about the details.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But I don't know Russian! There's no way I would have left that message!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not '<span style="color:#E16935">would have</span>'... There's no way you <span style="color:#E16935">could have</span> left that message...to be precise about the details.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Would you mind?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Forgive me, my dear fellow!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As I was saying... The person in question wrote the word '<span style="color:#E16935">wardrobe</span>' in Russian on the floor... ...in an attempt to incriminate me for the crime, even though I had been asleep in there the entire time.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And then, the same person picked up the broken glass <span style="color:#E16935">bell</span> that had fallen to the floor... ...for fear of it becoming <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> that would show how Mr Asogi really died.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But why wouldn't this person have taken all the pieces of the bell away? Leaving <span style="color:#E16935">half</span> behind was always going to raise questions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, well, um...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was past <span style="color:#E16935">one o'clock in the early hours</span> of the morning. The cabin would have been quite <span style="color:#E16935">dark</span>. The single, small lamp suspended from the ceiling would barely have cast any light onto the floor there. Little wonder then, that the culprit <span style="color:#E16935">failed to notice</span> a fragment of the tiny item.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
You all suspect me...don't you?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426133548" class="image"><img alt="Hold it Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Hold it Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426133548" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
S-Seaman Strogenov!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Nina is woman of sea! She is daughter of strong sailor. Two years ago, they noticed her dancing skills and she went away to join ballet company. But before...she was dancer on this ship. A member of ship's band. You do not accuse ship's angel of being kriminal!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, so that's it...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
You say that when young student died, Nina <span style="color:#E16935">was there</span> in his cabin. But that is not possible! I give my tooth!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, well... This is all most interesting... And why would you 'give your tooth', pray? How can you be so sure?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Hmph! You are <span style="color:#E16935">great detective</span>! You should know! Look truth in eyes! Cabin bulkhead was bolted shut <span style="color:#E16935">from inside</span>! Nobody could go into cabin. Not Nina, not anyone! Or you want to tell me that killer can walk through locked doors? ...Nyet! It's <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But wait! I've read about this in detective stories. People often tie thread around door latches so they can open and close them from the outside!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Thread</span>? Are you stupid? These bulkheads are not barn doors!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Certainly not. These are watertight doors, as one would expect to find on any modern steamship. Constructed of heavy steel, with not a gap in sight. No threads or needles or magnets could have been used.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No... No, of course not. I thought so, too. But Mr Naruhodo suggested it earlier, so...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Susato-san! How could you shift it onto me like that?!)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
So Seaman Strogenov has a valid point. The cabin door couldn't have been bolted shut from the outside.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not necessarily...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I put it to you that I could bolt this cabin door... ...without laying a finger on it.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And in this very cabin... ...we can see <span style="color:#E16935">the traces</span> of the method I have in mind having been used before!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I don't believe it!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, Mr Naruhodo? I believe you know what I mean, don't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A way to shut the bolt of the cabin door from <span style="color:#E16935">the outside</span>?)</span> One way does spring to mind, yes.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Do you really know what Mr Sholmes means, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. And so should you. Because we've <span style="color:#E16935">seen</span> it happen!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed we have! So, would you care to do the honours, Mr Naruhodo? <span style="color:green">Point out the telling signs of the method that was used to slide the cabin door bolt across from the outside!</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is it! This shows how it was done!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, it certainly shows how something was done, I concur. In fact, it's an excellent way to show how easy it is to jump to the wrong conclusion!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But a truly dismal way to show how the bolt could be made to slide shut from outside the cabin!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Did you really need to say 'truly dismal'...?)</span> 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Surely it can't really be possible to make the bolt slide shut without touching it all, can it?

I'm sure that it is. Something in the back of my mind tells me so...

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Look at <span style="color:#E16935">the bookcase</span> there. See how all the books and things on it have toppled over?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That must have happened when the ship made its <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span> before.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes, that's right. It's a very powerful vessel, after all. When the engines are thrown into reverse, a violent jolt goes across the entire ship. Any small objects that aren't fastened down are bound to fall over.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I believe... Yes, it's what's known as the force of '<span style="color:#E16935">inertia</span>' acting on the objects.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is there nothing Susato-san doesn't know...?! Or that isn't in her book, at least?)</span> Well, whatever it's called, the same force that pushed over those books on the bookcase... ...also made something else in this cabin <span style="color:#E16935">move</span>. <span style="color:#E16935">The bolt</span> on the cabin door.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was very obvious just after <span style="color:#E16935">the emergency stop</span> that the ship made earlier. We had come into this cabin not long before, and we hadn't bolted the door. But then...
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
Hello! Is anybody in there? Shout if you need assistance!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, that sounds like...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Inspector Hosonaga.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes! That's it! When the ship stopped suddenly, the bolt flew across and locked the door!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. It's made of metal, but it's small and light enough to be moved by the ship's sudden change of speed. ...Or the force of '<span style="color:#E16935">ineptia</span>', if you want to call it that.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Are, are you trying to say that last night... After Mr Asogi was killed... ...the SS Burya made another <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span>?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When I woke up this morning and looked around the cabin, I thought it looked a little odd. All the books on the shelves had toppled over. And all the ornaments. It was almost as if someone had run their hand across the shelves and deliberately knocked everything over.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, I remember that! And I stood them all up again, didn't I?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then when we came into this cabin, we were surprised to see the same thing in here. All the books and everything had toppled over, just like in Mr Asogi's cabin.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Oh my!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you have anything to say about this, Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Are you out of your mind? You say Burya made <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span>?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It does seem a little far-fetched. How could that possibly have happened? Unless you're saying that the culprit is actually someone from the engine room?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh, it is simple enough.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Are you forgetting <span style="color:#E16935">the button</span> in the passageway outside, used to trigger <span style="color:#E16935">the emergency alarm</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, of course... There was a notice, wasn't there? Telling you only to press the button in times of emergency.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
On dark nights when the fog is dense, the captain cannot afford to rely on the eyes of his lookout alone. Hence the placement of a number of <span style="color:#E16935">buttons</span> around the vessel to allow any crewman to raise the alarm. The sort of button one is almost compelled to press to satisfy one's curiosity...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
......... Wait! It, it was you?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
When <span style="color:#E16935">the button</span> is pressed, two things happen in the interests of safety: The emergency alarm bell rings, and the vessel comes to a complete stop. ...As indeed it did a little earlier today.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes... Surely it wasn't you who...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As I always say, <span style="color:#E16935">a button</span> has but one purpose in life. To be <span style="color:#E16935">pressed</span>! Whatever the occasion!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He sounds almost proud of himself!)</span>
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
How dare you mess with ship?! I report you to captain! You are in much trouble now!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now now, I'm sure all that can wait until later. Let us not overlook the fact that we have now learnt a valuable lesson. When the vessel makes <span style="color:#E16935">an emergency stop</span>, the bolts on the cabin doors slide closed. So...what we must now consider...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, it all comes down to one thing now. Last night, <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> what happened to Mr Asogi... ...did this ship make <span style="color:#E16935">an emergency stop</span>...or did it not?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
You are idiots! Burya is huge ship with many passengers. If we make <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span>, even in middle of night... ...there would be <span style="color:#E16935">chaos</span> everywhere!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What are your thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well... ...it's certainly possible that some kind of <span style="color:#E16935">emergency</span> happened last night. We have evidence to support that idea.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Really?! What <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Fascinating! Do show us, my good man! <span style="color:green">What evidence promotes the theory that some emergency gripped this vessel last night?</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This! You see? Do you see, Mr Sholmes?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Most regrettably... ...I see that the only emergency is that which your logical faculties are immersed in!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Argh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I knew he'd have something clever to say!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm really not at all sure that any evidence exists that can help us here.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Remember, Miss Susato, that evidence may not always be that which 'exists' per se.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There are days when evidence is that which is distinctly 'missing'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Today being one of those days, presumably.)</span> Now you say that, one piece of evidence does come to mind, actually.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Seaman Strogenov... ...it's your duty to patrol the first-class area of the ship, isn't that right?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Da! That is correct. ...Why?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And <span style="color:#E16935">the ship's log</span> here... This would be where you <span style="color:#E16935">record</span> the details of your duties?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What are you doing with that?! That is mine!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, you rather carelessly <span style="color:#E16935">left it</span> atop the little makeshift bureau in the passageway out there. But as responsible passengers, we took it into our care with a mind to return it to you later.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I <span style="color:#E16935">left it</span> there <span style="color:#E16935">on purpose</span>! That is where I put it always!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The point is, looking at what you usually <span style="color:#E16935">record</span>... ...it's clear that under normal circumstances, you write the phrase '<span style="color:#E16935">Nothing to report</span>' every thirty minutes. But from two o'clock last night until first light this morning...nothing was <span style="color:#E16935">recorded</span> at all.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Nothing <span style="color:#E16935">recorded</span> in the log?!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
That is... Da! Because nothing happened!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if nothing happened, you would normally write '<span style="color:#E16935">Nothing to report</span>', wouldn't you?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...*Gulp*
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed so. Which tells us that shortly after 2 a.m... ...<span style="color:#E16935">something</span> happened here aboard the SS Burya.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Something sufficiently significant to make you forget to fill in <span style="color:#E16935">the ship's log</span>, in fact.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Are you suggesting... ...that the ship really did make <span style="color:#E16935">an emergency stop</span> in the middle of the night?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Stop talking RUBBISH!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... If I'm perfectly honest... ...I find that a little hard to believe myself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh? Why?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Well, because if something as major as <span style="color:#E16935">an emergency stop</span> really had happened... ...surely all of us would have noticed?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's very true. Thanks to <span style="color:#E16935">the emergency stop</span> we experienced earlier, we all know what it feels like now. The ship <span style="color:#E16935">lurched</span> so violently. And <span style="color:#E16935">the alarm bell</span> was so loud... I can't imagine that anybody would sleep through that, even if it happened in the dead of night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, no... That's, that's a good point...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... What of...the throbbing?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Sorry? What do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your head, man. The throbbing of your head since this morning. We have all suffered with it.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Oh, yes... I have had a headache, you're right. In fact, I haven't been feeling myself since I woke up today.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Nor have I! My head has been feeling heavy ever since dawn.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, you've all been afflicted, haven't you? Just as I suspected.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right! My head's been throbbing today, too! And since eating dinner yesterday evening, everything has felt sort of hazy. I can't really remember anything that happened after I climbed back inside the wardrobe... Then the first thing I noticed this morning was the throbbing pain in my head. I had already been dragged out of the wardrobe... ...and had those handcuffs put on me by that point... Why didn't I wake up when all that was happening to me?!)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Tell me, Mr Naruhodo... ...you boarded this vessel as <span style="color:#E16935">a stowaway</span>, didn't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um... Well yes. ...Sorry.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The stowaway class of accommodation doesn't usually include meals. ...What did you survive on?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, well, Kazuma looked after me. He was always happy to share his meals.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So you enjoyed some of the whole roast chicken dish that was served yesterday evening, I take it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! In fact... ...I had all of that. Kazuma wasn't fond of chicken.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh really? So the victim <span style="color:#E16935">didn't eat</span> any of the chicken at all?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. He didn't touch it. ...Is that relevant?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... My dear fellow, does that not strike you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Mr Sholmes! Do you mean to say... ...that there was <span style="color:#E16935">something wrong</span> with the chicken?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...I do.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Really? Is that really true?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The meal prepared for the passengers last night had been <span style="color:#E16935">tampered</span> with. <span style="color:#E16935">Tampered</span> with by the addition of a soporific, designed to induce a very deep slumber in those who consumed it.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
...<span style="color:#E16935">A sleeping drug</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you mean...? ...whoever did this laced every meal with <span style="color:#E16935">a sleeping drug</span> so no one would notice the ship's <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span>?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! Of course that's not what Mr Sholmes means. What a far-fetched idea!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Precisely. Lacing every meal of every passenger on board with <span style="color:#E16935">a soporific drug</span> would certainly be impossible. ...Unless, that is, every single member of the crew was <span style="color:#E16935">a conspirator</span>!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Well, Seaman?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Eh...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm sorry to say that any more deception in this matter will get you nowhere.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If you refuse to talk, there would have to be an inquiry made through the shipping company, of course. And were that to happen, every member of the crew, and the captain himself, would be hauled over the coals. ...For aiding and abetting <span style="color:#E16935">a renegade</span>.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...! .........
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Please...no more. I will tell everything.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Eh?!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I cannot make problems like this for everyone any more...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
These crewmen are your former <span style="color:#E16935">comrades</span>, I believe.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Yes. So when I decided to...run away... I asked them to help me.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
We all agreed to help. Everyone together. She threw away everything. Her fame in the ballet... Mother Russia... We wanted to help our angel.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I don't believe it...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
You are right. We put <span style="color:#E16935">sleeping drug</span> in chicken last night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I remember now. I did notice chewing on a lump of something strange and bitter at one point...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Da. We could not make all <span style="color:#E16935">drug</span>... How do you say? ...Dissolve?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... Talk about heavy seasoning...)</span>
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...At midnight, in waters near Shanghai, we brought our angel on board. She was helped by comrade on shore with small fishing boat.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
While all the passengers of the SS Burya slept soundly... ...thanks to the almost magical effects of the slumber-inducing <span style="color:#E16935">potion</span> their evening meals had contained.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, if that's what happened... ...the only people <span style="color:#E16935">awake</span> on the ship last night... ...were the crew, people who dislike chicken and... ...the newly boarded passenger, Miss Pavlova.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...And that means it would have been <span style="color:#E16935">possible</span> for you. You could have used the emergency stop <span style="color:#E16935">trick</span> to lock Kazuma's cabin door!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But how does that make sense? Surely every cabin door would have ended up locked in that case, and there would have been complete chaos.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh, I wouldn't say so.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, of course! Just like us, all the other passengers would have eaten their evening meal of chicken in their cabins. After which they would have been overwhelmed by tiredness because of the sleeping drug.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Quite. And accordingly, all passengers were already in their cabins for the night.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The overwhelming majority of passengers would habitually sleep with their cabin doors bolted anyway. And so not one of them would have found it remarkable to find the door locked in the morning. In summary... In order to fasten the bolt of a single cabin door on the ship... ...the culprit brought the entire vessel to <span style="color:#E16935">an emergency stop</span> in the early hours of the morning!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
...!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
......... You have talked long time and said many things. What is point?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The point is what I said earlier. There was <span style="color:#E16935">somebody else</span> present on the scene when the victim lost his life last night. Someone who left a message in Russian on the floor in an attempt to incriminate another. Someone who tried desperately to hide the broken fragments of glass that would reveal the culprit's identity. And someone who abused the ship's <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span> procedure in order to lock a door. ...All told, a busy night.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
But...but... I...I don't know about any of this! I am just a little girl!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
You like to speak with your long English words and explain your clever ideas. But I am sailor. And sailors don't listen to long, boring stories. We don't believe. Sailors like me, we trust only what we see with our own eyes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... A laudable trait.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I am quite of the same disposition, my good man. Observation to me is everything. Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Yes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Do you hear it? That accusatory cry of guilt on the wind?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What 'accusatory cry of guilt'...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
S-Sorry, you've... You've lost me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Proof of involvement, man. But you can't <span style="color:#E16935">hear</span> such a call with your ears. No, you must hear it with your <span style="color:#E16935">eyes</span>! For observation is the basis of all deduction!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What are you TALKING ABOUT?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I believe the time has come... ...for one final '<span style="color:#E16935">Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</span>' to expose the truth! So, Mr Naruhodo, your assistance, if you please!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
With what exactly, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
With <span style="color:#E16935">observation</span>, my dear fellow! Just as I said. Of these two prevaricators.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Observation...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If you remember, Mr Naruhodo, we know that somebody tried to fabricate evidence, don't we? By <span style="color:#E16935">tampering</span> with the scene of Mr Asogi's death. What we're looking for is some <span style="color:#E16935">trace of evidence</span> that one of these two was there when it happened.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely! You are delightfully quick to grasp my meaning!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, I'll see what I can see! So we're looking for <span style="color:#E16935">a trace</span> of evidence that shows <span style="color:#E16935">someone else</span> was there last night when Kazuma died...

The truth is...I don't know exactly what trace of evidence this is going to unveil, but one thing is for sure... ...this man is definitely hiding something under his hat! When we remove it from his head, the revelations underneath will rock this boat...and the whole world!

I notice the dainty jewellery you're wearing on your ears, Miss Pavlova. Were we to find a piece of those earrings in Mr Asogi's cabin, it would prove beyond doubt that you were there! ...Although, we haven't actually found anything yet, so...

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I can think of two possible ways: Either we find a trace of something that the person in question left behind at the scene... ...or, if that's not possible...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...A trace of something that the person took away from the scene, be that accidentally or deliberately.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A trace of something someone took away...?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If you observe closely enough, I believe you will find examples of both. Give them a long, hard and uncompromising stare from all sides, that's my advice!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Seaman Strogenov... ...You seem to have quite a large purple <span style="color:#E16935">stain</span> on the back of your white uniform there.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Eh? Ah, yes, I, um... I don't know where the dirt comes from...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So nothing in particular comes to mind about <span style="color:#E16935">the stain</span>?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear that <span style="color:#E16935">the significance</span> of this stain has escaped your attention, Seaman. Allow us to make it plain!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's a very large purple <span style="color:#E16935">stain</span> on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And I think <span style="color:#E16935">what made it</span> is clear.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it is. So, Mr Naruhodo, present <span style="color:#E16935">the evidence</span> that proves it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My pleasure! Alright then. The evidence that proves what that <span style="color:#E16935">stain</span> on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform really is...

Yes?

...That a purple stain is perhaps caused...by something purple. Pray, what colour was the object you identified?

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! It's this photograph, and <span style="color:#E16935">the ink</span> it shows! That's what caused the stain on your uniform!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Ink?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A rather unusual colour of ink, purple.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, the penny drops...at last. Now you see <span style="color:#E16935">the significance</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The Russian word on the floor next to the victim's body was written in purple <span style="color:#E16935">ink</span>. And the stain on the back of your uniform...is <span style="color:#E16935">ink</span> of exactly the same colour!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If the ink had been dry, it couldn't possibly have stained your uniform in that way. Which means... ...you must have been present in the cabin in the moments <span style="color:#E16935">immediately after</span> the ink was spilt!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
......... Alright, yes. It was me. I did it. ...Everything.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I <span style="color:#E16935">arranged everything</span> in dead student's cabin to make it look like wardrobe man did it. Then I pressed button to make Burya do <span style="color:#E16935">emergency stop</span>, and bolt cabin door shut. ...I did everything so no one would suspect our angel.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Bif, please...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Don't worry, angel. Let me do talking. It was after one in the morning. I was on duty, patrolling passageway. Then our angel came to me. She was white like sheet.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Pavlova:<br />
'Bif! Please! You must help me!'
</p>
<hr />
<p>Strogenov:<br />
I went with her. The door to cabin number one was open. When I looked inside...I saw student boy on floor.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Strogenov:
</p>
<center>'Wha-What happened here?!'</center>
<p><br />
Pavlova:
</p>
<center>'......... Please...don't tell anyone... ...My little one... My little furry <span style="color:#E16935">friend</span>...'</center>
<hr />
<p>Strogenov:<br />
Everything that happened in cabin is like angel told you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The kitten escaped through the ventilator into Mr Asogi's cabin... Then he <span style="color:#E16935">tripped</span> over it and broke his neck when he fell to the floor?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...Yes. That is right.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
So after <span style="color:#E16935">the incident</span> when the cat ran away, Miss Pavlova then visited the cabin next to hers?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Only to find its occupant lying <span style="color:#E16935">lifeless</span> on the floor.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
She said she was worried when she heard sound of something falling on floor. That's when she went to look. ...No, angel?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
The door was not locked. So she opened to look, and...you already know what happened after.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There's just one thing...if you wouldn't mind?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
When you went to Mr Asogi's cabin, Miss Pavlova... ...was he...already dead?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Why...?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I already told you! When Nina opened door of student's cabin and looked inside-
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I was asking Miss Pavlova.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... ...<span style="color:#E16935">Дa</span>...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Yes...that is right. I saw him... It was dark, and he was wearing black, but... He was on the floor. ...Not moving... I was scared... .........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I understand. And...I believe you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So is that finally it now? Have we discovered <span style="color:#E16935">the real truth</span> about Kazuma's death at last?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah! Something very nearly slipped my mind!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
This photograph... Yes, I took this myself, you know. The cause of death was a broken neck. Therefore, the victim died instantly. And the unfortunate incident that precipitated these events? A kitten, on which the victim <span style="color:#E16935">stumbled</span>. ...However, if those are the facts, there is one particular area in this photograph... ...that seems to me somewhat <span style="color:#E16935">unnatural</span>.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
What do you mean, '<span style="color:#E16935">unnatural</span>'?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What are your thoughts on the matter, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? ...Oh! Well... <span style="color:#0070C0">(If Kazuma <span style="color:#E16935">tripped</span> and fell, and by some terrible stroke of bad luck broke his neck... ...which part of this photographic print seems <span style="color:#E16935">unnatural</span>?)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This word in Russian clearly wasn't written by Kazuma. So if you're looking for something unnatural, that's the obvious point.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Very true. It is certainly peculiar. But it's not what I meant by 'unnatural', I'm afraid. That particularly crass detail was orchestrated by the culprit. I mean to identify another point.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...I see.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Imagine, if you will, losing your footing yourself. In my opinion, if you landed as the victim appears to have done here, it would be most unnatural. I'm sure you'll reach the same conclusion!

It must be here! ...Surely.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Allow me to offer you a piece of advice regarding the pursuit of detection, my dear fellow. When noting a crucial point, it can be helpful to keep your eyes open.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...they were open.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And...it can be equally helpful to use them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Sorry. ...I'll try that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think it's plain what Mr Sholmes means by 'unnatural', isn't it? The word written in a foreign language underneath his fingertip, surely...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That particularly crass detail was orchestrated by the culprit. No, I mean to identify another point. Imagine, if you will, losing your footing yourself. Would you land as the victim has?

Alright, if he really fell due to an unfortunate accident... ...then this <span style="color:#E16935">fist</span> just doesn't seem quite right.

...The exact same thought occurred to me. In a fall, one's instinct is to <span style="color:#E16935">open the palms</span> flat.

Miss Pavlova, I notice that on your <span style="color:#E16935">ear</span>... ...even though you have a metal earring, <span style="color:#E16935">the decorative part</span> of it seems to be missing. The little link holding it on must have broken, I suppose.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Eh? What?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But looking at your other ear... ...I notice <span style="color:#E16935">a crescent moon</span>.

Ah!

I don't believe it!

<p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong. It's too late for words of advice!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The crescent moon is the last clue that Kazuma-sama left for us. And I believe it tells us everything!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So all that remains is for me to find out how. The answer must be here somewhere! I just need to look at this from all angles...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
Now, the missing <span style="color:#E16935">crescent moon</span> was found in the victim's <span style="color:#E16935">clenched fist</span>. ...Clearly there is only one logical conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes. Miss Pavlova... Mr Asogi must have <span style="color:#E16935">grasped</span> that <span style="color:#E16935">crescent moon</span> and pulled it from your <span style="color:#E16935">ear</span>. Perhaps just <span style="color:#E16935">moments before</span> he fell to the floor.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words... ...last night, in Mr Asogi's cabin, you <span style="color:#E16935">witnessed</span> the moment when the victim fell with your own eyes. In fact, you were quite literally at arm's length from him.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But then the question is, why did Mr Asogi do that? Why did he pull your <span style="color:#E16935">earring</span> from your ear, and hold it in his clenched fist during his final moments?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Oh no...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Angel...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No one can <span style="color:#E16935">protect</span> you now. Please, Miss Pavlova, tell us the truth. Last night... ...WHAT did you do to Kazuma?!
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Agh!<br />
</p>
<center>Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeт!</center>
<p><br />
</p>
<center>When I think about everything that happened yesterday... It, it was too much. Running away...the fishing boat in the middle of the night...trying to climb onto this huge ship... And then... ...when I was at last in this cabin and I could relax after this horrible, long day...
<hr />
<p>MIAOOOOOW!!!
</p><p>Darka! Wait!
</p><p>......... I couldn't believe it when she disappeared through the...the ventilator. I tried to call her with...a little whistle... I, I tried waving her favourite toy... But nothing worked. Darka would not come back.
</p><p>*Knock knock*<br />
.........<br />
*Clunk*
</p>
What are you doing here at this time of night, Inspector?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:<br />
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.
</p>
<hr />
<center>The young man from your country, he was very polite. And kind. He helped me to find Darka. And...he promised not to tell anyone. But then...when I had my friend in my arms again and I was going to leave the man's cabin...</center>
<hr />
<center>Just a moment! Sorry, but...</center>
<p><br />
Pavlova:<br />
Oh... Yes?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'm sure I know your face. I've seen you somewhere before...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ah, of course! You're <span style="color:#E16935">Nikolina Pavlova</span>, aren't you? The Russian ballerina.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Huh? N-No! I, I don't know that name.
</p>
<hr />
<center>My heart nearly stopped when he said that. He knew who I was! How could this man from a land in the faraway East know a Russian ballerina?!</center>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, I saw your performance in Japan. The beauty of the ballet made a deep impression on me. But...what are you doing on this ship? I'm sure I read that your ballet company was performing in Shanghai at the moment.
</p>
<hr />
<center>'...I can't fool him. ...I have to tell him the truth, and hope he doesn't tell anyone. I have no other choice.'</center>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, I see... So you've <span style="color:#E16935">run away</span>...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Please! Please keep my secret! Don't tell anyone!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...
</p>
<hr />
<center>'...He's going to pull that cord! He's going to tell the captain! Why did I think I could trust him?!' Then it happened... Everything at once... It was only a second, but...it felt like forever... 'Wait!' I shouted. And then...
<hr />
<p>MIAOOOOOW!!!
</p>
<hr />
Darka jumped out of my arms and down to the young man's feet. And... ...as he turned around to look at me... ...I, I pushed him! I don't even know why! I don't know why I did it! I, I was just so scared! And... ...I had to stop him from telling anyone about me.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
......... And that's when you went to fetch help? From Seaman Strogenov, who was on duty out in the passageway.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I heard Nina cry out, and thud on floor. So I ran to her. She was standing at cabin door, shaking like leaf. She looked at me and said:
</p>
<hr />
<center>Help me, Bif! If they find out, I will be... Please! I have nowhere to go!</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you decided to help. And that's when you <span style="color:#E16935">arranged things</span> in Kazuma's cabin to make it look like I did it... ...so that no one would suspect <span style="color:#E16935">the passenger</span> in the cabin next door?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...Yes. I went into cabin and I looked around...to make sure there was nothing to show Nina was there. And then I found <span style="color:#E16935">stowaway</span>. In wardrobe. Still sleeping.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Right. That's when he found me.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So you worked out a plan. To lay the blame on <span style="color:#E16935">the stowaway</span>.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
......... I closed wardrobe doors and put back strange paper <span style="color:#E16935">sign</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Luckily for me. That's the only reason Susato-san <span style="color:#E16935">started to believe me</span> when I said I was innocent.)</span>
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I dragged young man's body to good place, and used ink that was spilling to write on floor. I wrote '<span style="color:#E16935">ГАРДЕРОБ</span>' so that person who found him would look inside <span style="color:#E16935">wardrobe</span> and find stowaway.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And tell me, what of the glass bell?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
It was by my feet, so I picked it up.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I see.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
But it was dark in the cabin. I didn't notice the other half.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Then angel went back to her cabin, and I finished job.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
By pressing the emergency alarm <span style="color:#E16935">button</span> in the passageway?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
...Yes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Accordingly, the SS Burya did indeed come to <span style="color:#E16935">an emergency halt</span> at a little after 2 a.m. Thus enticing the bolt on the cabin door to slide shut, creating the <span style="color:#E16935">locked room</span> mystery.
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's still one thing I don't understand, Miss Pavlova.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, you said that you told Kazuma about the fact that you'd <span style="color:#E16935">run away</span> from your homeland. And it's because you were worried he was going to tell the captain that you pushed him. ...Isn't that right?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But even if he had pulled the bell cord and called for the captain of the ship... ...aren't you <span style="color:#E16935">friends</span> with every member of the crew? Why would that have been a problem?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
......... It was what he said first. That made me scared.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What he said first?
</p>
<hr />
<center>What are you doing here at this time of night, Inspector?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:<br />
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Pavlova:<br />
He said <span style="color:#E16935">an inspector</span>...was <span style="color:#E16935">his friend</span>...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah! Yes, meaning me... ...who was supposed to be acting as <span style="color:#E16935">his bodyguard</span>...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I thought that if <span style="color:#E16935">police</span> knew about me...they would arrest me. ......... So before he could pull the bell cord, I, I...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
May I stop you a moment, please, Miss Pavlova?
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It just...<span style="color:#E16935">doesn't seem to make sense</span>. I mean, was Mr Asogi really going to pull the bell cord? I don't know...
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well, I'm not Kazuma, so I can't know for certain. But... ...he was a man of his word. If he told you he wouldn't give your secret away, then he wouldn't have done.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
No! He, he was walking over to it! He was going to pull the cord! He was going to make them send me back...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, Mr Naruhodo... ...the day's work is not yet done, it seems. There is one more <span style="color:#E16935">deduction</span> to make.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Another <span style="color:#E16935">deduction</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes. What action was the victim really about to take at that moment? Can we determine whither the young man's <span style="color:#E16935">gaze</span> was directed? First, consider the victim's location within his cabin.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's easy. I remember every detail of that room. I mean, yes, I spent quite a lot of time in the wardrobe, but still... ...that cabin has been my home for this entire <span style="color:#E16935">voyage</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So this is how the cabin looked last night, when Miss Pavlova visited Kazuma-sama?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. It's exactly how it was.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Are you ready then, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! <span style="color:#0070C0">(If there's one thing I've learnt today... ...it's that a simple gaze can reveal all manner of <span style="color:#E16935">truths</span>. And not only that. In order to draw the right conclusion... ...you can't afford to be out by even a little bit when you're following the gaze to <span style="color:#E16935">where it lands</span>.)</span> So, when he turned away from Miss Pavlova, <span style="color:#E16935">what exactly was Kazuma looking at</span>?

Kazuma really wasn't the kind of man to ignore an earnest plea like that. It wouldn't have been at all like him to call the inspector when you'd asked him not to. But looking at this scene now...it's hard to see what possible other explanation there could be...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma had placed a large book of law underneath his pillow. I believe he was going to consult that book in order to find a way to help you. ...Although I'm not quite sure how Japanese law would have been relevant, but still...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Mr Naruhodo... ...the truth is absolute. You cannot see someone look one way, but follow their gaze another!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... Sorry. I, I had a feeling it was wrong.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
From where I'm standing, it was quite wrong. You appear to be out by a fair margin. ...Actually, no! You were out by a mile!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... Sorry...

<p>Sholmes:<br />
No one knows the workings of a man's mind better than his greatest friend, surely?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I knew him well. At the very least, I'm convinced of one thing: Kazuma wouldn't have just called a crewman or the captain in that situation.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
According to Miss Pavlova, Kazuma's exact words were: 'I could use another opinion here.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Whose opinion was he hoping for? I feel sure I ought to know...)</span> 
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Considering everything that had happened last night... ...certainly it may have looked as though Kazuma was going to ring <span style="color:#E16935">the bell cord</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes. However... ...what is directly beside the bell cord? <span style="color:#E16935">The wardrobe</span>.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
The...<span style="color:#E16935">wardrobe</span>...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And, more importantly, what was inside the wardrobe? The man's great <span style="color:#E16935">friend</span>. Sleeping soundly.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Miss Pavlova, please, think back very carefully. What were Mr Asogi's exact words last night?
</p>
<hr />
<center>Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...</center>
<hr />
<p>Pavlova:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Another opinion</span>'...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, but not from a member of the crew. No, Mr Asogi intended to consult his close friend on the matter. To see if, between them, they might be able to help in some way, no doubt.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
Oh no...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Sadly, we can't know the truth for certain now. It's too late for that. But I wish you had made sure of what Mr Asogi was looking at. Things may have ended very differently if you had.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Pavlova... I want to thank you for finally admitting the truth. But, unfortunately... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the truth</span> is, a man lost his life because of what you did. And that will never change. I hope you'll never forget that.
</p><p>Pavlova:<br />
I'm sorry... Really... I'm so, so sorry... What have I done...
</p>
<center>And so, at long last... ...the mystery surrounding the tragic accident on the SS Burya... ...was finally laid to rest.</center>

<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
What will happen to Miss Pavlova now then?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Once we reach Great Britain, she'll be handed over to the British police at Scotland Yard.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What about the fact that she <span style="color:#E16935">ran away</span> from Russia? Won't the Russians try to repatriate her?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Apparently the English detective can speak to the immigration office and sort all that out.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr Sholmes can do that...?)</span> So she won't be going back to Russia, then?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
No, I don't think so. Even if she wanted to return in the future, I doubt she would be able to. She ran away, so now she's <span style="color:#E16935">an exile</span> for life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I'm sorry...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Seaman Strogenov?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
I wanted to help our angel. No matter what. But...I didn't think about you. About how you lost good friend. I will go with Nina. I will give myself to British police.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's kind of you. In the meantime...thank you for letting me <span style="color:#E16935">go free</span> again. Kazuma's death...feels like such a waste. But... Well...do what you can for Miss Pavlova, won't you?
</p><p>Strogenov:<br />
Da.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Well, I'm afraid you need to pack now. We're due to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow. As much as it pains me... ...I'm going to have to hand you over to the consul to arrange your <span style="color:#E16935">passage back to Japan</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I did <span style="color:#E16935">stow away</span>, after all. I couldn't really expect any different.)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
So, you should get back to your cabin now.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like my study tour to Great Britain is over before it's even begun, then. To think that only days ago, Kazuma and I were laughing together about how we'd tear up the streets of London... That seems like a distant memory now.)</span> ......... Oh...what's that? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Is it...someone weeping?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Susato-san?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...! Naruhodo-san! I, I didn't know you had returned.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, erm, well...I haven't been back long. Inspector Hosonaga just told me I should pack. You know...ready to leave the ship tomorrow and all that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... ......... I still...can't believe this has happened. I can't believe someone's life can be over, just like that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Susato-san...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He had such grand ideas for this visit to Great Britain. So many dreams. And now they've been cruelly <span style="color:#E16935">taken away</span>. ...Just as he has. I thought I could never forgive the person responsible. But now... ...now we know the truth. That it was just <span style="color:#E16935">an accident</span>. Just a silly series of <span style="color:#E16935">mishaps</span>. It's too much, Naruhodo-san. It's just too much...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes, I know.
</p><p>???:<br />
I wish there was something...I could say...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Inspector...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
My duty was to see Asogi-san safely to Great Britain. But I failed. And caused his two closest friends great pain and suffering as a result. I've let everyone down. And I will do ANYTHING to make up for my terrible blunder!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Nobody blames you, Inspector. And I'm <span style="color:#E16935">free</span> again now, at leas- Huh?
</p><p>Sholmes:
</p>
<center>Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</center>
<p>Surprised, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...is the meaning of this?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh, a trifling matter. Simply that in my head, I think I shall always picture you <span style="color:#E16935">wearing those shackles</span>. Without them, the balance seems all wrong. It's...<span style="color:#E16935">distracting</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So I decided to restore them. For old times' sake, shall we say? You are <span style="color:#E16935">a stowaway</span>, after all. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He thinks this is funny?!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes... We do appreciate all your assistance. I'd like to thank you...from the bottom of my heart.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not at all, not at all. And though it's a little late, may I offer my sincere condolences? The loss of your companion is truly heartrending. I hope that you will be able to fulfil some of his aspirations in his honour.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I'm afraid that won't be possible. We shall be disembarking at the next port. In Hong Kong. We have to return to Japan and make a full report about everything that's happened.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Wait a minute! It's just me that has to go back, isn't it? I mean, I was <span style="color:#E16935">the stowaway</span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The terms</span> of this study tour were negotiated by the Department of Justice in both Great Britain and Japan. It was to be one lawyer and one assistant.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'Was to be'?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
In the light of Mr Asogi's unfortunate death... ...I'm afraid the study tour can no longer go ahead.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh no. I don't care for me, but... ...poor Susato-san.)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
My dear fellows, the majority of problems have an extremely simple solution, you know!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
All you require is one <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>, and the study tour can continue, surely?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But there is no one else with the necessary qualifications, Mr Sholmes. We know of no other <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Qualifications, you say? Any qualifications obtained in your own country will be of little value in Great Britain, I'm afraid.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, but...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But anyway, the voyage to London still promises a good month of time. Ample opportunity, I would say, to find yourselves another suitable <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Yes...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um...Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you think perhaps...I might be able to do it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But you're not a lawyer, Mr Naruhodo. Oh, unless... Are you studying law?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I'm not, but-
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I'm sorry. In that case, I don't think there's even a chance it could work.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But as I said, there is still more than a month before we reach England's shores. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I have a month in which to study! To learn what I must to become a lawyer in Great Britain.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's ridiculous! Are you seriously suggesting anybody could learn all of that in just forty days?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's only one way to find out! I would work my fingers to the bone, Inspector. Every single day. ...Will you let me try? And if, by the time we reach Great Britain, I haven't learnt enough to be recognised as a lawyer... ...I'll take whatever punishment is deemed appropriate.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
But...why put yourself in such a difficult position?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
For Kazuma. He said that there was something he had to do in Great Britain. And that he would sacrifice anything to make it happen.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He was <span style="color:#E16935">passionate</span> about it. I can't let all that passion just come to nothing. And anyway, it's for my own benefit, too. I will become <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>. I have to. ...What do you say, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... ...I think it's a wonderful idea.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Thank you...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So...what does our bespectacled inspector friend say?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Are you serious?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
One lawyer and one assistant. The numbers are indisputable.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
No no no! It's madness!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yet fascinating, wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Fascinating</span>'?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Duty and rules are the dull routine of existence that we all abhor. Give us <span style="color:#E16935">interest</span>! Give us <span style="color:#E16935">fascination</span>!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Speak for yourself</span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Besides... ...qualifications are no measure of a man. What matters is his character...no?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And you've witnessed ample evidence of this man's exemplary character today with your own eyes. From the early hours of this morning until this very moment now. Despite contending with the passing of his close companion, and despite the accusation of guilt... ...this man has shown resourcefulness, intelligence and above all, courage.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... Very well. I'll think of a clever way to word my report to the Department of Justice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
After all, I did just make a promise, didn't I? I said that I'd do anything at all to make up for my shortcomings here.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, thank you, Inspector!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
If you'll excuse me, I must pay a visit to the captain's quarters, I think. I need to discuss what to do next, and how best to make my report.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Are you really prepared to attempt this, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I'm going to try. I wonder... ...would you consider teaching me what I need to know? Everything about being <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I would be delighted to help you! I AM a judicial assistant, after all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And...Mr Naruhodo... ...I'd like you to take charge of this.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Me?! ...Are you sure?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sure it's what Kazuma-sama would have wanted. Its name is 'Karuma'. It's a great sword, that's been in the Asogi clan for generations.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Very well, I accept. I'll treasure it always. So then, Miss Susato... ...it seems we'll be working together for some time to come yet!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It will be an honour, Mr Naruhodo. And for the next forty days, I shan't grant you a single minute of freedom. We shall fill every spare moment with study!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! That's exactly what I need!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...before we begin... I have an earnest favour to ask of you, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Goodness. ...What is it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Please throw me to the ground. Three times!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I should never have doubted you. You were Kazuma-sama's closest friend. Of course you would never have done anything to hurt him. That should have been obvious to me from the start. But I allowed suspicion to get the better of me. And no matter how upset I was feeling...it was completely unforgivable behaviour.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! No, you were in shock. You'd just found out about me <span style="color:#E16935">stowing away</span>. And the cabin door was locked from the inside-
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No! I won't let you make excuses for me! Whatever the circumstances, I should never have thrown you! And not just once, but FIVE times!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That number keeps creeping up, doesn't it?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Please, you must! Just take hold of me and throw me! Do it! Don't even think about it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no no! I don't even know how! I've never thrown anyone in my life!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Very wise, Mr Naruhodo. It isn't a skill one acquires without considerable training.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Mr Sholmes...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I observed your throwing technique several times with great interest. I confess I was most impressed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(When did he see that?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I presume that would be a form of Japanese wrestling?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well...in a way. It's not wrestling, but my own interpretation of an ancient jujutsu technique.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Apparently it's called the Susato Takedown. It leaves your head swimming, believe me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm... How beguiling... I am a practitioner of the combative arts myself. I am a somewhat accomplished <span style="color:#E16935">boxer</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There he goes, dancing around again...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I wonder if you'd be so kind as to instruct me on the technique of your arresting <span style="color:#E16935">throw</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Yes! I'd be honoured!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then let us not dally! Demonstrate, my dear madam!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Of, of course! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Haiiiiii-YA! ...As you can see, you throw from the abdomen.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh yes, arresting indeed! And that is what you term <span style="color:#E16935">the Susato Takedown</span>, is it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Actually, no. That was <span style="color:#E16935">a Susato Squash</span>!
</p>
<center><span style="color:#0070C0">(In my groggy state of consciousness... ...<span style="color:#E16935">a scene</span> from an evening recently spent with Kazuma flickered into my mind...)</span></center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...'<span style="color:#E16935">Karuma</span>'...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's right. It's a prized sword that's been passed down through generations of the Asogi clan.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I can't believe you managed to get permission to bring it with you! I mean, taking a katana on a study tour is more than a little irregular, surely?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A Japanese man's sword is his soul, Ryunosuke. I can't be parted from my katana. Karuma guides me. I truly believe that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So its name compels its wielder to <span style="color:#E16935">slice evil in two</span>? Not that you would need much compelling...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
On that subject... ...there's something very important that I have to do in Great Britain. And I'll sacrifice anything to make it happen. I'd appreciate you seeing it through with me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of, of course I will. Whatever it is, I'll see it through to the end with you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...I knew you wouldn't let me down.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#0070C0">(That <span style="color:#E16935">important thing</span> he had to do... I still don't know what that was. But I'm going to see the place for myself and work it out. In Great Britain's capital...London.)</span></center>

Just following the natural progression of the deduction! Sometimes the truth hurts!

That 'deduction' was wanting in every way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I was wanting you to hear it. I'm quite proud of it!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I find myself wanting never to have heard it. I'm quite pained by it, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh... Sorry. I'll try again.

Hm... Sadly, Mr Naruhodo... ...despite being all about trifles, great deduction is no trifling matter. There is no place for guesswork.

Ugh... Sorry...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm afraid you have developed a shocking habit for it. And it is quite destructive to the logical faculty. Reasoning is an art, and there are only so many times you can erase your work.

Don't lose heart, Naruhodo-san. I believe in you. Those eyes of yours won't let you down. I'm sure they'll help you find the truth in the end!

......... Right... I need to put trust in my own <span style="color:#E16935">observational skills</span>...
