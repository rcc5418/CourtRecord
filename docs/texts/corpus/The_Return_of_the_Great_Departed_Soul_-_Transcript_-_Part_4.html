The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</span></center>
<p><br />
Harebrayne:<br />
Good morning to you, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, good morning, Professor. Ready for today's proceedings?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... I hope so... I should be... Even I, with nothing left to-
</p><p>Sholmes:
</p>
<center>Good morning, my dear fellows!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, Mr Sholmes! You're here!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why, naturally! A true gentleman stands shoulder to shoulder with his friends in battle at all times!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you. I really appreciate it. ...I'll...see you later, then. Now, Professor... We really need you to remain calm in the courtroom today.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. Do try your hardest not to enter the witness stand uninvited again.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Yes! I will! I, I realise it was a mistake, but I-
</p><p>Sholmes:
</p>
<center>My dear fellows, I must interject!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...you're still here, Mr Sholmes. What's the matter?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Surely you've overlooked some praise, have you not? To be cast in my direction, hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? I don't follow.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Must I spell it out? I, the great Herlock Sholmes... The greatest detective, of worldwide acclamation... ...arose at some ungodly hour to be here now! First thing in the morning! A miracle, you must agree!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...if I must agree, then...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As you know, my sleep is quite impregnable. Iris had to employ her full gamut of tactics: She pulled the covers off, shook me, poked both cheeks, punched me and kicked me from the bed. Then she poured a boiling cup of her latest experimental blend on my face and at last I was bestirred!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my... Iris has been busy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Iris doesn't have it in her to go that far. She's too nice.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Ah, I sense the spirit of a fellow scientist! One who relishes the infinite possibilities of blending tea!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm the one worthy of praise here! Not Iris! This is my victory!
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>Sorry to cut in...</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, Inspector Gregson! Good morning!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Gregson, my dear fellow, why the grim expression at this delightfully early hour?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I've been confronted with a grimmer expression, eh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Dear me... Are you going to take that insult lying down, Professor?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Wha...? WHAT...? I DOOON'T KNOOOW!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Professor...)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Anyway, here's the paperwork you asked for.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What paperwork?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, I took the liberty of requesting it yesterday. I have a feeling it may prove useful.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
You wouldn't believe the hoops I had to jump through to get this brought out of the archives. It's the Professor's autopsy report.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That... That mass murderer's?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who killed five members of the aristocracy...)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
He was found guilty in a closed trial ten years ago now. It was all done under wraps. And he was quickly executed soon after the trial. ...It's all in here.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The killer's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I don't know what to say! Thank you, Inspector!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, much obliged, Gregson.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Us lowly lot at the Yard are just doing what we can...in the shadow of the great detective Sholmes, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well then, Professor Harebrayne...this is it! Today we're going to lay all this to rest at last.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wish you the best of luck, Professor!
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... I suppose...he'll be in there today, will he? Drebber...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. We expect the prosecution to summon him as a witness.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I'm still amazed that you managed to find him in just one day... I really owe you both so much!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Counsel! And the defendant! The trial is about to resume. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it then. The final chapter. Funny. My heart's racing a little... I've not felt this before, actually. This strange foreboding... As if...something's going to happen in this trial that I'm not ready for. But I can't let that distract me from the only thing that really matters... Finding the truth!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">24th October, 9:30 a.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the public hearing of Albert Harebrayne, here present, who stands accused of murder. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution is ready, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... The defence is ready, My Lord. <span style="color:#0070C0">(As promised, Lord van Zieks has his apprentice with him. His apprentice with memory loss...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If I may, Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes, My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
There appears to be someone standing at your side...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ah, yes. My apprentice and assistant. The prosecution believes today's proceedings will see the complexity of this case rise considerably. I therefore instructed my assistant to attend to ensure the smooth running of the trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And the smooth running of liquid refreshments, by the look of it...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The way he holds himself... The way he moves... It couldn't be anyone else...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But he's still suffering from amnesia...so there's really nothing we can do at the moment.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I know, but... Oh, this is so very hard.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It would appear the prosecution has done a fine job in responding to the demands of the court made yesterday. I understand you have successfully secured the engineer who disappeared from the scene on the day in question.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Yes, My Lord. I intend to call him as a witness shortly.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very good, very good. Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...who have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this courtroom today... ...are you ready and willing to proceed?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Of course, My Lord. I'm sure we all understand the importance of doing our civic duty.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I do so despise deception and deceit. I find it so very wearing...
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
To take a man's life with a conjuring trick... It is against the magician's code, not to mention the law.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Any fake scientists should feel the wrath of God, if you ask me!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Wasn't like this in my day. Wasn't like this at all...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If all parties are ready to proceed, you may begin, Lord van Zieks.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Before I do, My Lord, there is a report I must read to the court. Yesterday at the Great Exhibition grounds, the evidence of primary importance in this case... ...the super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine, which was installed on the experimentation stage... ...was deliberately destroyed in an explosion effected by an unknown person or persons.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
It was...WHAT?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
An explosion?!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
This...is an outrage!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, I heard this grave news yesterday. Scotland Yard submitted a report to my office in the evening. I read that the machine was blasted to smithers, and the wreckage reduced to ashes in the flames.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I have here a photographic print of the scene, taken in the wake of the explosion. It shows what little remains of the machine.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, yes... A terrible business...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He did it to destroy the evidence, did he?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That Enoch Drebber...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court will take this print as evidence, Counsel.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The post-explosion photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Late yesterday afternoon... ...the protection afforded to the machine by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act was revoked. However, before a thorough investigation could begin, the invention was obliterated from existence. As such...this will become a very different trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As it stands now, with no evidence on which to draw meaningful conclusions... ...the authenticity of the kinesis machine will remain forever in obscurity.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, indeed... A most unfortunate state of affairs.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
However, one thing remains clear: The victim's death was the result of the actions of the accused. Of that we can be certain. For it was <span style="color:#E16935">the accused himself</span> who was operating the machine and who ultimately caused its loss of control.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As Lord van Zieks rightly says, this is a very different trial now.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The accused accepts responsibility for his part in the events that transpired. He acknowledges that Mr Asman died as a result of the accident caused by his machine's malfunction. However, unbeknownst to the professor... ...he was being deliberately deceived by a pair of very clever fraudsters.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Names, Counsel, if you please.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, and the victim himself, Mr Odie Asman.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So what exactly were these two men up to behind the defendant's back?! The defence intends to expose that information, thus establishing the unequivocal innocence of the defendant!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsels. The positions of the prosecution and defence have been clearly stated. Lord van Zieks, summon your first witness, please.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
At once, My Lord. The prosecution calls the engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, to the stand!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
State your name and occupation for the court.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Name...<span style="color:#E16935">Enoch Drebber</span>. Occupation... ...<span style="color:#E16935">hard to pin down</span>, I would say.
</p>
<center>See that black monocle?<br />Yes, why do I feel as though I've seen it somewhere before...?<br />Oh! You, too? I had exactly the same feeling myself.<br />Hm...</center>
<p><br />
Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your file indicates that you are currently being investigated in connection with another case. The theft...of a waxwork model, is it? A most extraordinary-sounding business.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...But that <span style="color:#E16935">has no bearing</span> on this trial, I assure you. Cleave it from your mind.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You're familiar with the public experiment carried out at the Great Exhibition some days ago? The accused's super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis demonstration.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes...you could say that. <span style="color:#E16935">I am aware</span> of it. There was <span style="color:#E16935">a terrible accident</span>, wasn't there?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It was you, Mr Drebber, who constructed the vast machine used in the experiment. Or so our investigations indicate. Can you confirm your involvement?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, I constructed it. In precise accordance with the blueprints. But <span style="color:#E16935">that's all</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Then the court would be very interested to hear your thoughts about the machine, I'm sure.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... <span style="color:#E16935">An amazing device</span>, if you ask me. <span style="color:#E16935">The pinnacle</span> of modern science, making instantaneous kinesis a reality at last.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good... Good gracious! Do you mean to say... ...that the experiment was <span style="color:#E16935">bona fide</span>? Is that your belief, sir?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, that is very much my belief. Such a waste that it blew up.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But we've already established the machine was nothing more than a prop for an elaborate conjuring trick!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You've established nothing of the sort.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
All that was shown during yesterday's proceedings... ...is that the same outcome <span style="color:#E16935">could have been produced</span> by means of stage trickery. The defence merely proposed a method and demonstrated its feasibility, nothing more.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...but...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We've procrastinated long enough, I feel. Witness, you will now give your formal testimony... ...about the machine that you constructed for the purpose of the demonstration at the Great Exhibition.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...Understood.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Kinesis Machine -</span></center>
<p>Drebber:<br />
I met <span style="color:#E16935">the young professor</span> approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction.<br />
He provided me with the blueprints and I <span style="color:#E16935">constructed</span> the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick.<br />
If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required <span style="color:#E16935">a body double</span>. Tell me...did the victim have a twin?<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">All the spectators</span> saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.<br />
A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was <span style="color:#E16935">flawed</span> somehow?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A, a body double?!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
That <span style="color:#E16935">goes without saying</span>, surely? To give the impression that something has moved when in reality it hasn't. It's a basic <span style="color:#E16935">conjuring</span> principle. The deception cannot be achieved without <span style="color:#E16935">substituting</span> the original with a fake at some point in the performance. But would I be right in saying...you haven't managed to establish anything <span style="color:#E16935">along those lines</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Incidentally... ...the prosecution has already confirmed that Mr Asman had no twin siblings.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... It's my understanding that this witness is well-versed in conjuring artfulness. But such talents do not indicate that he was actually able to accomplish what he claims. Namely the construction of what, by all accounts, must have been an extremely complex scientific machine.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...Whatever do you <span style="color:#E16935">mean</span>?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yesterday's proceedings brought the true nature of your past exploits to light, Mr Drebber.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Indeed it did, My Lord! As a swindler who preys on innocent scientists to elicit government grant money through conjuring know-how.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...Yes, it's true that I possess considerable knowledge of <span style="color:#E16935">stage magic</span>. But crucially, my scientific knowledge more than matches that of <span style="color:#E16935">any</span> academic in the field.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Investigation of the witness's workshop attests to that claim, My Lord. As evidence, the police found this Royal Society trophy for young talent in science there.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's true. We spotted it there ourselves!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
If a hypothesis is <span style="color:#E16935">sound</span>, it can always be forged into a physical manifestation...with sufficient skill. Though I may have sold <span style="color:#E16935">the secrets</span> of some deceptive wiles to snivelling, talentless scientists in the past.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Would, would you therefore assert...that the explosion of the machine was...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
An unfortunate accident. ...Or, of course, a deliberate act of murder carried out by <span style="color:#E16935">misuse</span> of the science.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you were already acquainted with Mr Asman himself?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Not really. <span style="color:#E16935">By chance</span>, I'd seen his name mentioned in the papers, that's all. But I had <span style="color:#E16935">no interest</span> in his private affairs. If he was an unscrupulous investor, it was no concern of mine. As long as people pay their bills, I take up my tools and <span style="color:#E16935">construct</span> what they ask for.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So why did Mr Asman approach you in particular, then?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Who can say? I presume because my name is associated with <span style="color:#E16935">excellence</span> in engineering.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Not to mention excellence in fraud.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Hard to gauge. But the point is, <span style="color:#E16935">all I did was construct</span> the machine according to the blueprints I was given.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In other words, the kinesis machine was built on solid scientific principles.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, <span style="color:#E16935">you might say that</span>. Professor Harebrayne certainly has <span style="color:#E16935">a mind</span> like no other.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's clear that you have both scientific knowledge and knowledge of conjuring magic, however.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
The more knowledge you have, the <span style="color:#E16935">better</span> equipped you are to handle whatever comes along. But your implication is that I <span style="color:#E16935">furnished</span> the machine with some trickery, I think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's a possibility that we have to explore.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Unfortunately though, the machine has been <span style="color:#E16935">blown to kingdom come</span>. So there's really <span style="color:#E16935">nothing left</span> to explore...is there?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It appears that the kinesis machine was fitted with a timed explosive device of some kind.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
And there's <span style="color:#E16935">nothing left</span> of that device either. Not a single shred of evidence remaining...I hear.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(He must have planned all this from the outset.)</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Perhaps my learned friend wasn't listening earlier. ...Mr Asman had no twin siblings.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I heard you before. ...But the thread of hope hadn't quite left me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The demonstration could have been a trick, if there was somebody who looked sufficiently like the victim. But Dr Sithe absolutely ruled that out as a possibility.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It is beyond question that <span style="color:#E16935">the victim himself</span>, Mr Asman, did move from the stage to the Crystal Tower. The fingerprints found at the scene attest to the fact.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So it can't have been orchestrated using someone who looked identical to Mr Asman then.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! No...nothing. <span style="color:#E16935">Just that the idea of <span style="color:#E16935">someone who looked identical</span> to the victim is playing on my mind...</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It crashed 'headfirst', you say?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
According to the <span style="color:#E16935">many witness reports</span> from those there at the time, yes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Were you not there at the exhibition grounds on the day?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Hm...unlikely. I <span style="color:#E16935">rarely leave</span> my workshop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yet another of your unique inventions was found at the scene.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... Well...it was <span style="color:#E16935">the unveiling</span> of a machine I'd laboured over for many months. I saw it <span style="color:#E16935">clearly</span> with my own eyes. The birdcage plummeted headfirst into the tower.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What a surprise...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I believe <span style="color:#E16935">the victim's neck was broken</span> from the headlong fall, wasn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How would you have come by that information?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Even an <span style="color:#E16935">infernal</span> recluse like me reads the newspapers, you know. According to the reports, <span style="color:#E16935">two injuries</span> were apparent on the victim's body.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, he'd been stabbed in the chest by a screwdriver believed to belong to the defendant... ...and he had broken vertebrae as a result of a fall from a considerable height.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Correct. My learned friend has been doing his research, it seems.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do we know which injury was the fatal one?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Sadly not. Forensic science is not yet at a level where such things can be determined.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What we do know is that the victim died having sustained both injuries at some point during the experiment. And since he was found in the birdcage with his neck broken...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...It's obvious that he <span style="color:#E16935">fell from a considerable height</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We've examined the birdcage that crashed into the Crystal Tower ourselves. As you can see, the cage, which is a wooden construction, has sustained damage in one particular spot.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Following the explosion, it fell some thirty feet into the glass of the Crystal Tower. That level of damage is to be expected, surely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I agree. The damage itself is entirely understandable. What doesn't make sense... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">the location</span> of that damage.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
All the breakages in the wood are at <span style="color:#E16935">the base</span> of the birdcage, not the top!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">What</span> are you saying?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's <span style="color:#E16935">the opposite</span> of where they should be!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right, My Lord. The birdcage that was at the scene is damaged at its base. So we have reports of the birdcage falling headlong into the Crystal Tower, yet the damage is at the bottom. The only way to reconcile these two facts is to accept... ...that there were <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> birdcages in play that day, which were at some point switched! Switched during what wasn't a scientific experiment at all...but an elaborate piece of stage trickery!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Gaaa</span>aaaa...gh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! Explain yourself, witness!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I...<span style="color:#E16935">well</span>...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If we examine the facts, there's only one logical conclusion we can draw. The damage on the base of the birdcage clearly indicates that it crashed tailfirst into the tower.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But multiple witness reports claim it fell headfirst!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The birdcage materialised in the sky next to a balloon flying over the stage, following a spontaneous explosion. At an altitude of some sixty feet above ground level.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Which is approximately eighteen metres.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It then proceeded to fall some thirty feet into the Crystal Tower in the ensuing deflagration. Witness reports amid such chaos...are notoriously unreliable.

He plummeted thirty feet inside a heavy, wooden cage. However he fell, it would be unsurprising to find one or two of his vertebrae crushed.

Ah yes, and there's one more point the defence appears to have <span style="color:#E16935">forgotten</span>. It obviously <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't a trick</span>...as a certain truth very plainly demonstrates.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well, before the demonstration began, the victim was <span style="color:#E16935">alive</span> on stage in front of the audience.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...there are lots of witnesses who saw Mr Asman on the experimentation stage, that's true.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
And the victim's neck broke as a result of <span style="color:#E16935">an impact following a fall</span>. Logically, therefore, the victim must have fallen <span style="color:#E16935">from</span> somewhere.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The balloon that exploded was at an altitude of sixty feet. The point of impact on the tower was thirty feet up. That difference of thirty feet is therefore the total distance the birdcage fell.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
And there's <span style="color:#E16935">no other location</span> from which the cage could have fallen that distance if it didn't drop out of the sky. Ergo... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the victim himself</span> must have been beamed from the stage into the sky above the Crystal Tower.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmmmmm... A trenchant, scientific analysis. Dear me, every time I hear it explained, it sounds increasingly plausible.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Oh <span style="color:#E16935">yes</span>. It's all <span style="color:#E16935">very well thought out</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Certainly all the spectators on the day saw it. The birdcage plummeting thirty feet through the air, I mean.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you understood the science, did you?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Not in the slightest</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Right...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
As I've said a number of times, I'm an engineer. My job is to manufacture <span style="color:#E16935">according to the blueprints</span> I'm given. I would be inviting manifold <span style="color:#E16935">problems</span> if I foolishly allowed my brain to digest the ideas behind them. I could be accused of <span style="color:#E16935">stealing</span> those ideas, for example.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But how is it possible to construct a machine without really understanding the principles it relies on?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well, you're practising law <span style="color:#E16935">without really understanding</span> the principles it relies on, aren't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... A very good point.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Stand up for yourself, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The point is, the experiment resulted in instantaneous kinesis taking place. As such, the science must be sound.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes. And really, experimental results are <span style="color:#E16935">all that matters</span> when it comes to proving a hypothesis.
</p>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's certainly very sure of himself...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, now that the machine has been completely destroyed by yesterday's explosion... ...it's going to be impossible to argue its authenticity one way or the other.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But if we're unable to establish that it was a piece of stage trickery rather than genuine science... ...we will have no grounds on which to demonstrate Professor Harebrayne's innocence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Both Mr Asman and this man in the stand tricked the professor and used him. They took advantage of his naivety and his unbending belief in his work...and I won't let them get away with it! <span style="color:#0070C0">(And seeing as the professor is an old friend of Lord van Zieks... ...what on earth must he be feeling towards Drebber?)</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We know that somehow, the birdcage appeared in mid-air before falling down into the Crystal Tower. A fall of about thirty feet...or nine metres. However, if you examine the diagram carefully... ...you'll see that there is one other possible location from which the birdcage could have fallen... ...the same distance of thirty feet.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, it appears the defence has a possible explanation to put forward. Go ahead, Counsel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord. Of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram. <span style="color:green">The alternative location from which the birdcage could possibly have fallen the requisite thirty feet!</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If that's my learned friend's claim, I suggest he demonstrates for the court...personally.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And you may consider this a parting gift, Counsel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... I feel like I've just hit the deck from thirty feet up anyway now...)</span>

Don't give me recourse to make the next fall from sixty feet up, hm?

</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The place I'm referring to...is here!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But that's... ...where the birdcage would have been to begin with!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which is exactly the point, My Lord. Yes, the birdcage was in the machine on the stage. But what we must also consider, is the height of the stage itself.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Go on, Counsel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It turns out that the experimentation stage was built at a considerable height <span style="color:#E16935">above ground level</span>. If you look at the diagram, in fact... ...you'll see it's at <span style="color:#E16935">about the same height</span> above the ground as the balloon was above the crash site.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When the experiment got underway, the machine and the birdcage were engulfed in steam. At that moment, the floor of the stage gave way and, if we assume there to be a void underneath... ...this birdcage and the one seen by the audience would have fallen almost exactly the same distance! Once again, My Lord... ...this all points to the fact that there was not one birdcage, but two!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My learned friend...has no evidence that the stage had such a contrivance in its design!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Someone is responsible for the criminal destruction of the kinesis machine itself, it's true. However, the stage still stands. And take a moment to look at the photographic print of the scene following yesterday's explosion.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord! <span style="color:#E16935">The metal grille</span> that formed the floor of the machine is undone!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, most likely blown open by the force of the explosion that destroyed the rest of the machine. The defence calls for the space below the stage to be investigated...immediately! Mr Drebber!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was you who built the kinesis machine. Which means that it was you who built the two birdcages that were used to carry out this deception.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Uh...ughhh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Whether Professor Harebrayne's hypothesis is sound or not makes no difference. Because it's the construction of this machine that matters. A machine designed to take Mr Asman's life... ...and lay the blame firmly at the professor's door. Something that could only have been carried out... ...by you, Mr Enoch Drebber!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Grrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If my learned friend has reached the end of his wild assertions... ...the prosecution would like to crush the defence's argument slowly...but surely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Your argument fails to hold water... ...on two counts.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Firstly... ...before and after the experiment, this witness went nowhere near the kinesis machine. Every relevant member of staff from the exhibition has attested to that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And I believe members of Scotland Yard have also been on watch duty at every public experiment.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In other words, Mr Drebber had <span style="color:#E16935">no opportunity</span> to switch the alleged pair of birdcages.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But I've already explained why he wouldn't have needed to!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The nonsense with the crossbow? That doesn't bolster your case at all. The man who disappeared from the stage and the man who crashed into the tower are <span style="color:#E16935">one and the same</span>. The Forensic Investigation Team's report is unequivocal on that point!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And the second flaw in your assertion... ...is a distinct lack of motive. Why would this man have wanted to take the victim's life? He had <span style="color:#E16935">no reason</span> to do so.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A...a motive...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Do I have to think of everything myself?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I have here a contract provided by the witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What contract is this, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The contract into which Mr Drebber entered with the victim, Mr Asman. It reads: 'Mr Drebber is to receive <span style="color:#E16935">thirty percent</span> of all remunerations from government grants or other income.'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thirty percent? Certainly very favourable contractual conditions.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
But there was one very important <span style="color:#E16935">provision</span> bolted onto that clause.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What provision?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
'Mr Drebber may only uphold this right on condition that both contracting parties are <span style="color:#E16935">alive</span>.'
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
In other words, if either of us were to die, the contract would become <span style="color:#E16935">null and void</span>. So you see, I had <span style="color:#E16935">nothing to gain</span> from Mr Asman's death. The diametric opposite, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Need I say more? The witness had neither an opportunity nor a reason to commit the alleged crime. In short, the possibility of Mr Drebber having done as you suggest...is nil.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAH!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... It seems the defence's assertion was somewhat wide of the mark. Lord van Zieks...you will submit the contract as evidence, please.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Drebber's contract has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's true... If Drebber had no opportunity to switch the birdcage under the stage with the one in the Crystal Tower... ...he couldn't have done it. And in any case, I have no idea what his motive might have been!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There is one aspect of your argument... ...that still holds true, however.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There were <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> birdcages. The prosecution is unable to deny that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So I'm sure you're on the right lines, Mr Naruhodo. And I've no doubt there are other aspects of your assertion that are undeniable truths, too!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, it would seem... ...that the defence has no rejoinder to offer.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... Kuh kuh kuh... Well, I must say I'm a little <span style="color:#E16935">surprised</span>. I came here to testify about the machine I built, and instead my reputation is <span style="color:#E16935">defiled</span>. But the prosecution's counter has <span style="color:#E16935">set the record straight</span>, I think. It's <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span> that I'm the culprit.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At the beginning of this trial, we believed that there was only one birdcage. Yet now we know there must have been two. In other words, there was more to the demonstration than we realised at first.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I think it's abundantly clear that the same applies to the culprit.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Get to the point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The stage demonstration... ...was constructed and set up in its entirety by you, Mr Drebber. Therefore it's inconceivable that you had no hand in the events that transpired.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So if circumstances mean it's impossible that you could have carried out the crime <span style="color:#E16935">yourself</span>... ...it points to the fact that <span style="color:#E16935">someone else</span> was involved.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Someone else? Counsel, are you suggesting...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord! Mr Drebber had <span style="color:#E16935">an accomplice</span>!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
An accomplice now? Well then, I presume... ...you're prepared for what's to come? Now that you're accusing not only this witness, but someone else...of the most serious of crimes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If these accusations turn out to be false... ...then make no mistake: The prosecution will demand an equally serious punishment for your slander!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Counsel? Do you intend to pursue this course, and formally accuse another party of involvement in this matter?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What do I do here? At the moment, this is little more than a hunch on my part. I don't know for sure if Drebber had an accomplice, or even if he really is the culprit here...)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Who is this person?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Someone intimately related to the crime, My Lord...and someone you surely wouldn't say you don't know!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, thank you, I am aware of the person, obviously. But on what basis do you claim felonious involvement?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You surely wouldn't say you don't know...would you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uwaaaaaagh!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sure you simply slipped and pointed to the wrong person, didn't you? There's no other explanation!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
No 'slip-ups' this time, please, Counsel.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The name of the person in question is...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What's wrong, my Nipponese friend? Surely fear doesn't bind your tongue now. It's a little late for that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course I'm afraid. After all, naming her in this capacity is definitely going to make waves. ...A lot of waves. I could very well turn every single person in this courtroom against me.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sure it will be alright, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Thank you, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The enemy always appears larger than life. But you'll appear exactly the same to the enemy!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Alright then, here goes...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You've kept us waiting long enough. Your answer, Counsel...now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The person who colluded with Mr Drebber in order to carry out this wicked crime... ...is Scotland Yard's coroner, <span style="color:#E16935">Dr Courtney Sithe</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What, what the blazes are you talking about? Dr Sithe?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The head of the Forensic Investigation Team, and the coroner who conducted the autopsy on the victim?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We know there were two birdcages. So who could have carried out the switch to complete the illusion? The 'accident' happened in front of a huge crowd of spectators, and the area was immediately sealed off. Then everyone, police officers included, were banished to make way for the Forensic Investigation Team. When else could the switch have occurred? It can only have been in that team's presence.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's essential that the court determines exactly what happened following the incident. The defence demands that Dr Sithe be summoned to the witness stand at once to testify!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
You've got a nerve, lad! Standing up there, dragging the Yard's name through the mud!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I didn't mean to...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I know the woman veeery well. There's no better dead room worker out there! How dare you call her a criminal?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My learned friend's imagination appears to be wilder than the East End at night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But the recklessness of your accusation aside, there's another grave problem with your argument. One which the prosecution demands you address at once.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A grave problem?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my word...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Who do you claim acted as the victim's <span style="color:#E16935">doppelgänger</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
W-What?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Certainly, if the 'birdcage' containing the body of the victim was exchanged for another... ...that cage must also have contained a body.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And yet... ...no missing persons or accidental deaths of anyone even remotely resembling the victim have been reported. Which means there was no one, dead or alive, who could have fulfilled the role of a body double for Mr Asman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's true! If my argument is that there were two birdcages, then there must also have been one person inside each! But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I? What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?)</span>

We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage. And therefore he couldn't have been inside the second birdcage.

Yes, Counsel, according to your somewhat elaborate version of events.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You started by indicting the leader of the Forensic Investigation Team as an accomplice in this crime. And now you've moved on to indicting waxworks?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes! That's about the size of it.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But why? And why THIS waxwork? It looks nothing like the victim. In fact, it could hardly resemble him less! What possible justification can you give?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If you want to know why... ...ask Mr Drebber.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Just days before Professor Harebrayne performed his public demonstration... ...Mr Drebber <span style="color:#E16935">abducted</span> this model from Madame Tusspells.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Did, did you say...abducted?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And two days after the incident at the Great Exhibition... ...he returned it to the museum.

Then the timing...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is this true, Mr Drebber?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Ugh... Urmm...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At first, I couldn't see why Mr Drebber would have stolen the waxwork and then given it back again. But now, the reason is clear. He took it so that he could put it inside the second birdcage...as a body double for Mr Asman!

It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.

Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, the applause is deafening. ...And yes, I know it seems extraordinary. But that's the point. That's why I have a strong feeling it's actually a greater <span style="color:#E16935">clue</span> than anyone yet realises...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I can't explain why at the moment... ...but I feel as though there's a specific reason why it was used. Why it had to be this model.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Really? A reason why nothing else would do, you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. And I'm convinced... ...it's something far more significant than whether or not the model looked like the victim.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well...if that's the case... ...we must prevent the trial from ending prematurely at all costs!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, agreed. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to find a way out of this...!)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...the order of things seems to have changed around here for some reason...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I'm a copper, lad. It's a copper's discretion to bend the rules sometimes, when needs must. What's wrong with that?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Where do I start?)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I've been working at the Yard for forty odd years!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...even more than I thought.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
We've only had a metropolitan police service in town for seventy years, you know. 'Course, times have changed. The public didn't trust coppers back when I started. It was rough. We had to fight crime, and we had to fight to win the public's trust as well. And win we did. Forensic science was in its infancy too, even more than it is now. And she spearheaded the revolution!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dr Sithe, you mean?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
That's right. About ten years ago now, it was. When I was still a youngish bobby on the beat. That's when she started making a name for herself as a top-class coroner. And now look at her! Head of the Forensic Investigation Team. And a woman, no less. Well you won't hear me complain! It's what we all dreamt of back then, I tell you!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Could you tell me without holding that gun in the air?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
We were all out to uphold justice, lad! Full of vim, we were. Full of vim.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's coming across loud and clear.

That woman is still the best coroner in the land! Head of the Forensics Investigation Team!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...'legendary' was your description, sir, not mine.

Rubbish! That word never passed my lips! I'd never describe anybody that way! Ever! Not if they were still in the game!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...juror number two.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: <span style="color:green">The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor!</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have here a certain autopsy report from ten years ago.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A ten-year-old autopsy report? What relevance does that have?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It is of course from the autopsy of the person portrayed in the waxwork: the killer known as <span style="color:#E16935">the Professor</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The Professor's...? But the man was a capital offender, so...

That's right. This is the certification of death that was drawn up <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the convict's execution.

Oh my! <span style="color:#E16935">Courtney Stevens</span>?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Strike a light!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
And do you suppose...there's some unsavoury relationship between those events?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Absolutely! I'm sure of it! There's no doubt in my mind that the Professor case... ...is at the heart of <span style="color:#E16935">a link</span> that we have yet to uncover... ...between Dr Courtney Sithe and Mr Enoch Drebber!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
......... Hidden links...mysterious connections...secret relationships... This is all most extraordinary. We're surely obliged now to explore this further.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Quite right. We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day! But we're still here to uphold justice in the end!

The man behind those murders on Solar Pons Street was caught in two days flat. That's real policing for you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...really not relevant to this case, is it?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
You're wrong there. Because it was <span style="color:#E16935">Dr Sithe</span> in charge of examining the bodies. And it was evidence arising from her work that led to the arrest of the scoundrel responsible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...

That's right, 'Oh.' That woman is at the forefront of this country's fight against crime. The idea that she's somehow involved in this murky business is a load of old tosh.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why would you assume that?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Well, quite simply because...that unsettling swindler has no relationship with the woman, does he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
True. As it stands, we don't know of any connection.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh gosh, but it would be delightfully romantic if they were somehow to have a mutual interest in the waxwork.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Romantic?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
A woman of society such as myself views everything in terms of relationships, you know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, you learn something new every day! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Even if you don't want to.)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
One might wonder about a possible relationship between the defendant and this coroner woman. Or perhaps between the defendant and the handsome prosecutor just there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This woman...may be more astute than I've been giving her credit for.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If that's the woman's stance... ...then perhaps demonstrating some connection between the waxwork and Dr Sithe would be enough...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I agree. As soon as we have even a whiff of a connection, she'll be the first to know!

Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad. You won't have any colour left to drain.

I said before that the court could not overlook your claim of evidence. But it seems to me that overlooking it would have been the more preferable choice by some margin.

What sort of problems?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Let's just say we have run into each other on numerous occasions while I've been performing on the street.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right, I see.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Obviously artists such as myself cannot appear on stage as we work in close proximity to our audiences. So we perform our great magic in parks...on street corners...and the like. But the police use any excuse to make our lives difficult. Sometimes they even cook up a story to extort monies from the poor.

I grant you, given that this cage appeared from amidst an explosion, there'd have been no need to use a real person. But if a waxwork had been used, the culprit could at least have had the decency to make it look like the victim.

<p>Juror No. 4:<br />
What's that? A piece of glass? Though it's unusually thick for glass...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it's a piece of broken glass that we found inside the jacket on the waxwork. As you say, it's not ordinary glass, though. It's very thick, and clearly made for extra strength. Much like the special glass that was developed for the construction of the Crystal Tower.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
The Crystal To- Holy smoke!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly! The centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, where the very incident we're talking about took place! On the day in question, the birdcage fell from above and smashed through a window of that special glass.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
From whence this small piece originated...is that it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Precisely. So, what do you say... ...now that clear evidence in support of the assertion has been placed before you?!

......... Well, as I said, I only trust men in white coats as a rule. However... ...when the reasoning is sound, it's fair to say colour shouldn't come into it. In light of what you've shown me here, yes, I feel obliged to change my position on the matter.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I've got to ask...why have you brought that corn into court with you?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Colonel Cob? Ee's bin growin' back on the farm. Picked 'im off on me way into town. Ee's a proper nibbler, ee is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the nibbling seems to be taking quite a while. Maybe it could wait until after the trial?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Ooh, I don't like the sound o' that. You need colonels at times like these. Whenever I've summat big to decide, the colonels always point me in the right direction, see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-You're talking about your cob of corn?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Perhaps it's akin to fortune-telling with flower petals like people do back home?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So Professor Harebrayne's fate is to be decided by a cob of corn...)</span> Could you not at least wait until we've had more time to find the truth before deciding on the defendant's guilt?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Ooh, I don't know about that. Me tum's awfully full already.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
......... Ooh, you mean me?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You've pointed out that it's wrong to make an accusation without evidence. But the accusation that the waxwork model was inside the second birdcage on the day in question... ...is not without supporting evidence. As the defence demonstrated to the juror sitting beside you.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
......... Ooh, is that right?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Would it be fair to say... ...you didn't follow the argument?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I don't understand much besides Colonel Cob, to be honest.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course you don't...)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
If I could interject here...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please do, sir.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Now that this assertion of yours about the waxwork has been backed up by some solid evidence... ...it would be wrong of me, as a man of science, not to pursue the matter further.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Ar, well, me too, then!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
If this brainy gentleman says ee's right, then ee must be! See...I, um... ...I wouldn't dream of goin' against Colonel Cob or anyone who's got stuffin' between the ears!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Success! ...If you can call it that.)</span>
</p><p><i>Changes Juror No. 4's statement to "The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research."</i><br />

<p>Juror No. 5:<br />
<span style="color:green">Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I know it seems a little far-fetched to think that the waxwork model of the Professor was in that birdcage... ...but on the other hand, it explains a lot.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If there really is a reason why that particular waxwork had to be used as Mr Asman's double... ...we must do everything we can to make the jurors understand it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The truth is, I'm sure that's the key to this, but it's the most puzzling part of it, too.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In that case, you should see what additional information you can glean whilst trying to change the jurors' minds. If you can read a book whilst eating a rice cracker, Mr Naruhodo, I'm sure you can do this!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Right. Yes!
</p>
<hr />
<p><i>After Jurors No. 2, 4, 5, and 6 vote innocent:</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel, that will do. As a result of the summation examination, the jury's overall leaning has changed. Two jurors now call guilty. Against four who call not guilty. Accordingly the court has failed to reach a consensus at this time... ...and the trial must continue!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We, we did it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! Another wonderful victory!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm, a waxwork of the despicable Professor... ...used as a 'body double' for the victim in this quite extraordinary case... I must say, it's extremely hard to believe the assertion could possibly be true. However, it would appear that it does at least warrant further investigation.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's the waxwork of the Professor that links Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe. And I'm convinced that there's a special significance to that link!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I don't know what you're hoping to prove, lad, I really don't!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The truth, sir. By using evidence and testimony.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hmph.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If the court is to delve deeper into the alleged involvement of the waxwork in this case... ...then the prosecution calls for the owner of the model to be summoned as a witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The owner?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Madame Tusspells.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I, I really thought... ...that Lord van Zieks would object to this whole line of enquiry...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, I concur. Make arrangements for Madame Tusspells to appear as a witness with immediate effect.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Listen carefully, my learned friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh... Yes?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You should know... ...that you're on the brink of opening Pandora's box. .........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court shall now adjourn for forty-five minutes. During that time, the prosecution will summon the new witness and prepare her for taking the stand.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Madame Tusspells, yes. I shall see to it at once, My Lord.

The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</span></center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:<br />
Ah, the knight-errant himself!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, have you been watching from the gallery, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I've been on the edge of my seat the entire time! Courtroom trials are fascinating affairs. As a spectator, at least.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm glad you've been enjoying yourself...
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I, I have to ask... ...what on earth is going on?! It makes no sense! What's this Professor business all about? He doesn't look like any professor I've ever met before! Who even is he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, of course... ...you were in Germany already ten years ago.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the Professor... When I discovered 'he' was the one who had been abducted, a sense of foreboding stirred within me. But who knew the monster would come knocking at your door? My heartfelt sympathies! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As it turns out... ...Lord van Zieks is even more intimately tied to this case than any of us realised, isn't he?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, how true. His great friend from university in the dock...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...And now a waxwork of the killer who took his esteemed brother's life makes an appearance, too. I imagine even the shrewd Mr Reaper failed to foresee that kick in the teeth. An extraordinary move on your part, my dear fellow, to throw that in front of the man.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You make it sound deliberate...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I can't help feeling... ...that this Professor case is really very puzzling.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh yes? In what particular manner?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, there's Mr Drebber, Dr Sithe and Lord van Zieks... It seems that everybody in the trial has a link to the case somehow.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Yes, in fact I, alone, am not a member of the set! Though that leaves me as an empty set...all alone with no intersection to any other...
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>Excuse me.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
D.........D.........Dr Sithe!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, Dr Courtney Sithe, née Stevens. Good day to you.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Hello, Sholmes. That was very shrewd of you.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...What in particular, pray?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
You requested that ten-year-old autopsy report from Gregson, didn't you?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why would you assume such a thing?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Because Gregson told me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
To think it's been ten years... Ten years in the laboratory, wielding my scalpel. I smell of nothing but corpses and disinfectant.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A policeman on the jury had a lot to say about you as it happens, Dr Sithe. And I've...accused you of being complicit in what happened. I'm hoping that you'll take the stand and tell the truth about what really happened.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
That certainly won't be possible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But attempting to hide from the truth... That's cowardice!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I've always fought crime in the way that I see fit. I have no regrets. None at all. And that's all I came here to say. So...good day to you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... She mentioned it, too. This Pandora's box...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Whatever does it all mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There's really no cause for concern. I assure you, when the trial resumes... ...the meaning will become all too apparent, whether you'd like it to or not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now then, I believe it's almost time. I must make my way back to the public gallery. The edge of my seat awaits!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I think maybe you're enjoying yourself a little too much...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Alright, I understand. ...Thank you.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Good. I shall make myself scarce, then. I purchased a bar of caramel earlier, so I shall be gnawing on that as you gnaw away at the truth!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What did that warning from Mr Sholmes really mean, I wonder? Especially the bit about 'whatever may come to pass'... .........)</span>
</p>
<center>It's time for the final chapter, then. I'm determined to find the truth... ...no matter what.</center>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">24th October, 12:40 p.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready and able to continue?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution is ready, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord. The defence is also ready.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As the court is aware, the case under our scrutiny began with a damaging incident at the Great Exhibition. Yet we now find ourselves embroiled in the details of a convicted felon who was sent to the gallows a decade ago. This trial has certainly defied all expectation.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As seems to be the fate of all trials in which this Nipponese is involved, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So then... ...let us begin our exploration of the defence's assertion that the waxwork was cardinally involved in this matter. Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are we still awaiting the arrival of Madame Tusspells?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Not at all. She is in the antechamber as we speak and ready to be summoned.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Bring in the witness!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
At once, My Lord. Bailiff! Show Madame Tusspells to the stand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Things are about to become a lot more intense. If Drebber is responsible, as I'm sure he is, it means he must have had <span style="color:#E16935">an accomplice</span>...in Dr Sithe.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And what <span style="color:#E16935">connects</span> the pair of them...is the waxwork.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, the model of the Professor... That's the key to the link between these otherwise unrelated individuals. It's a tenuous link, admittedly. But at present, it's all we have to go on.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
State your name and occupation for the court, please.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
My name is Madame Esmeralda Tusspells. I am a waxwork artisan. And the proprietress of the Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork. You will have to pardon me for working as I testify. My new exhibit must open very soon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, so he finally gets a statue, does he? Now there are two of them in the world...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my... What expression is she carving onto that face?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
A number of days ago, a particular waxwork model was stolen from your museum. Can you confirm this?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui. That is true. At first, we believed it had been <span style="color:#E16935">kidnapped</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A waxwork model? Kidnapped?!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Yes, My Lord. There was a demand for <span style="color:#E16935">ransom money</span> left behind by the culprit. However, according to what I have just been told outside the courtroom, that was not the true reason. I understand it was utilised as <span style="color:#E16935">a substitute</span> for the body of a murder victim?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
At present, that is no more than conjecture proposed by the defence. This is the victim of the case in question. Mr Odie Asman.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
But of course, I know him well. He is a part of my odious personages exhibit. ...I detest to say what is evident, but Mr Asman does not resemble the Professor at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, but...perhaps! Perhaps their faces are very <span style="color:#E16935">similar</span>!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Are you suggesting that we should see now <span style="color:#E16935">the demasked visage</span> of the Professor? I have here the key, but it is strictly forbidden to open the lock.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This is absurd!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I don't know what face you've carved onto your fancy figure beneath that mask... ...but clearly it won't be that of the actual killer.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. The man's identity was never made public, after all.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The trial took place in a closed court. The proceedings were strictly confidential. The condemned man was summarily executed. His identity remains a closely guarded national secret. There is no possible way that a repository of tawdry exhibits could get its hands on that information.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Quel dommage. It would seem you are unaware of the Tusspells' principles.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What principles?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
The family Tusspells has always prided itself on sculpting its models à la perfection. Every detail, including the visage, is fashioned with complete fidelity. ...Et voilà: our principles.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There is a well known legend about the Tusspells waxworks from the time of the French Revolution. A member of the Tusspells family is said to have made a waxwork of the queen who was executed.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui, that is true. It was a century ago now.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I believe the queen's face was carved in the minutes following her death, actually at the guillotine site.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
You are correct. The model is on display still today in the House of Horrors. We Tusspells will stop at nothing to obtain a faithful replica of our subjects.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Dear me... A somewhat disturbing tenacity of purpose.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
It is the only way to obtain a truly lifelike representation of the subject. And it has been my family's secret for generations.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do, do you mean to say...that beneath that mask...?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui. The true visage of the killer is there.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...This is ludicrous. It's out of the question!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
The Professor spread terror throughout Great Britain. As a result, the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit remains extremely popular even today. The killer...emerging from his own grave... It is a sight to behold. You should come.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I think, madame, it would be beneficial to hear your formal testimony on this matter. You will explain every detail of this macabre model. And your personal involvement in its creation.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
...With pleasure.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Professor Waxwork -</span></center>
<p>Tusspells:<br />
The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London.<br />
An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles.<br />
I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment.<br />
I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.<br />
As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
The gravedigger?! The man sanctioned this?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui. I will do all that is necessary to achieve the true resemblance my family is celebrated for. Nobody else knew. Only the gravedigger. What harm did it do, uh?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So you truly saw it? The face of that monster!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Naturally, I was aware at the time that his identity was a secret. But Tusspells would not be Tusspells if we did not insist on absolute fidelity to our sculptures.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I don't believe this...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I myself have seen the special exhibit at your museum, madame. A truly blood-curdling scene, in which the murderer is emerging from his own grave.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
The scene it depicts was the subject of many rumours in London ten years ago. I have here a newspaper from the time. The special exhibit was based upon the picture in this article. It was the most detailed account of what happened, as reported by the eyewitness who saw it.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The ten-year-old article has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
'Man Rises from the Grave!'... It's too absurd for words.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
The public enjoy absurdity, monsieur. That is why I have reproduced the scene as carefully as possible in my museum.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And it's a waxwork from that exhibit that was stolen some days before the incident at the Great Exhibition, wasn't it.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
That is correct. The Professor you see before you here.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... Most puzzling... Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This waxwork links Drebber to Dr Sithe... And there has to be some reason for that, which hasn't yet come to light. But I'll find it. I'll get to the bottom of what really happened. I'll prove that Dr Sithe and Drebber were in on this crime together!)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that rumour would be...?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
A ten-year-old tale now...but one that no Londoner would ever forget.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Ah, right. I know just what you're talking about, I think.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Of course, it couldn't be anything else...
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yes, that story will never disappear.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
The tale of the condemned killer rising from the dead... That is the central attraction of my House of Horrors. The rumour was whispered all over the city. And it was like this...
</p>
<center>It was in Lowgate Cemetery behind the prison, in the dead of night after the execution of the killer. The interred Professor slid back the stone slab covering his tomb, and emerged from his grave. A young man who witnessed this felt a scream welling up inside him... ...but an instant later, he heard an ear-splitting gunshot from over his shoulder. The bullet struck the emerging corpse... and he fell motionless once more. The scream finally found its way from the mouth of the young witness, who turned and ran for his life.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
The, the corpse climbed out...of his own grave...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And then somebody shot him? Who, who was it?!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Nobody knows, even today. But remember, it was just a rumour. ...Perhaps nothing more than a ghost story. The good people of London, they love stories like this. That is why it was in every newspaper across the capital.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but was it just a story? I mean, this is exactly the scene that can be seen today at your museum, isn't it?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui. The special exhibit was modelled on that very illustration. For a while afterwards, the contents of that article were reproduced in every newspaper imaginable.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Madame, might I say something?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Please, go ahead, mademoiselle.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
When something is described as a rumour, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's entirely made up. I believe that often...rumours contain elements of the truth.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah, I see that people from the East can be just as astute as the people of Europe.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Can we be sure, for instance, that the Professor's execution was successful?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... It is not possible for the dead to come back to life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ten years ago, I was there in Lowgate Cemetery. After the criminal known as the Professor was killed by hanging... ...I took a wax impression of his visage from the corpse just before it was interred. So I can assure you... ...the man was dead.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I see.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... It would certainly appear that the condemned man suffered the intended fate.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is, is that true of every waxwork in your museum then?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
It is...assuming the subject is dead, of course. Live subjects have to cooperate in a similar way. I have letters from imprisoned criminals all the time, you know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What sort of letters?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
'When my time comes, please make a waxwork of me.' ...Comme ça.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
My museum is famous, monsieur. To be made into a waxwork is an honour. And for some criminals, a symbol of status, even.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Because nothing says hardened criminal better than... wax.)</span>
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
And it is thanks to one killer in particular, that my museum has gained such popularity in London. I refer to the star of the special exhibit, of course. The Professor.

It would seem the proprietress of this repository of novelties was blinded by monetary good.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
It had nothing to do with money. The man is part of London's criminal history. That is why I had to sculpt him. To record this history. It is the raison d'être of the Tusspells museum.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if the man was convicted in a closed court and sent for immediate execution... ...then surely nobody but the members of the judiciary present know the killer's true identity.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
I can assure you, behind that mask is hidden <span style="color:#E16935">the true face</span> of the Professor.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You were there longer than you expected to be?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
...I had some...difficulties in capturing the subject's form correctly. As I removed the mask, the mouth of the cadaver fell open and I had some problems with the chin.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dare I ask...?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
The man had been dead for a short while already, you see. His muscles were relaxing and consequently his chin would not align itself correctly.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear...what a horrible thought...
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Under normal circumstances, I would have an assistant with me. However, that night, I was alone. And as a consequence, I missed my preferred window of time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
When I take the impression of the visage of a cadaver... ...I always wait until three hours after death.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why three hours? Is that amount of time significant?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
It is because of <span style="color:#E16935">rigor mortis</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A...wriggly mortice?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's the name given to a phenomenon that occurs in recently deceased bodies. As a rule, three hours post death, the muscles in the body begin to stiffen. By approximately ten hours post death, the entire body is completely rigid and inflexible. And then from that point on, the muscles slowly start to revert to their relaxed state. The effect is often used to <span style="color:#E16935">estimate the time of death</span> when a body is discovered!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well, that was an education. If a slightly scary one.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
As the mademoiselle says, rigor mortis commences three hours after death...and it starts in the jaw.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I see. So that's why you wait.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Before that time, the mouth falls open...and it is very difficult to do my work.

Well...I could not say. But when I left the cemetery with my utensils and wax, the morning light was becoming visible.

The execution took place on 17th June...which had the earliest sunrise of that year.

For some reason, Dr Sithe went along with Drebber's plan. Now, if that's really true... ...then the Professor is the only other thing we know of that links the pair of them. So I feel sure that waxwork must be a clue to this mystery somehow...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In that case, we must use this cross-examination to uncover exactly what it means! Otherwise the jurors are sure to revert their leanings and the trial will be over!

<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Madame Tusspells... I have here an autopsy report that was filed ten years ago now. It confirms the death of the Professor following his execution at the gallows.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
And...is that a problem?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I believe it is. Because your testimony, and a particular detail in the report... ...completely contradict one another.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Quoi?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Are you going to explain yourself, my Nipponese friend?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to her testimony, Madame Tusspells was creating her wax impression just before dawn. And at that time, rigor mortis had not yet set in. Am I correct so far, madame?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
You are, yes. As I said, the stiffening of the jaw is the first sign of rigor mortis, two to three hours after death. But the man's chin was limp, so he cannot have been dead for a long time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But on the other hand, if you look at Dr Sithe's report... ...it quite clearly states the following: 'Death by hanging confirmed at <span style="color:#E16935">midnight</span>, 17th June.'
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If the Professor indeed died at midnight that day... ...then by the time you were sculpting his face, rigor mortis would already have set in.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui! Yes, you are right. The chin, it would have been completely stiff.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words, this report...is wrong!

No coroner makes mistakes when recording the time of death! The very idea is absurd!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In that case, there's only one possible conclusion: The execution <span style="color:#E16935">didn't actually take place</span> at the stated time!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Im...Impossible!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is beyond folly! Not only do you indict the author of the report, Dr Sithe... ...but you also implicate members of staff at Barclay Prison where the execution took place!

The Professor <span style="color:#E16935">died</span> that night. Without question!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You're suggesting it was a corpse, coming back from the dead now?!

The man in question...is Mr Enoch Drebber!

Drebber?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The, the previous witness?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The special exhibit in the House of Horrors at Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork... ...recreates that decade-old scene in great detail. The condemned criminal emerging from the grave... And beside the tomb... ...a young man with a lantern stumbling upon the terrifying sight. And that young man... ...is a ten-year-younger Mr Enoch Drebber!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Surely not, Counsel?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Drebber was there? In Lowgate Cemetery?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Um... What is all this talk about Mr Drebber? Is the name significant?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course. Madam <i>[sic]</i> Tusspells doesn't know, does she?)</span> Yes. It's extremely significant, madame. To your situation as well, in fact.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
What situation?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The theft of the Professor waxwork from your museum some days ago... ...was perpetrated by the very same man.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Non! But...but that would mean...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Madame Tusspells... ...it would appear you know the name...Enoch Drebber.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Oui. yes, I know it. But from long ago in the past.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Explain yourself! Tell us everything you know!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Yes... Yes, of course.
</p>
<center>The story of the young man and the terrible sight he witnessed in the cemetery ten years ago... ...was published in every single newspaper in London and throughout Great Britain. However... ...in all of the articles, the witness was simply described as 'a certain young man'. No details were published about his identity. His name was never revealed. That is, apart from in one newspaper.</center>
<p><br />
Tusspells:<br />
The Daily Circus. It is the paper from which comes the article I have already shown the court.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're saying that his full name was only publicised in that article?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness me! Yes, here it is! 'The university student who experienced this shocking event is <span style="color:#E16935">Mr Enoch Drebber</span>... ...a disciple of science at the University of London, and a resident of its student dorms.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Unbelievable!
</p><p>Tusspells:
</p>
<center>When I read the article, I went to meet with the man. His discovery of the condemned criminal coming back to life in the cemetery in the dead of night... ...would make a perfect exhibit for my House of Horrors, whether it was the truth or not.</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
I see. So you went to meet Mr Drebber in order to sculpt a waxwork of the man, did you?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Exactement. He was studying science at the University of London in those days. He was just a poor student. I paid him five pounds to model for the waxwork. And since that time, it has been in my museum to recreate the scene of terror from the cemetery.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, ten years ago, a young man appealed to the public about an extraordinary event he'd witnessed: A criminal who had been put to death, re-emerging from his grave in the middle of the night. But the public treated his claim as nothing more than an amusing anecdote...that was soon forgotten. Ten years later... ...the same man steals a waxwork model of the executed criminal... ...ostensibly to use as <span style="color:#E16935">a body double</span> for the victim in the case we're discussing here today. Even though the waxwork's build is <span style="color:#E16935">a poor match</span> for the victim, and its face is obscured by a mask. So the question is...why would the man do such a thing?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which brings us to three days ago, when the birdcage crashed into the Crystal Tower. If the birdcage had in fact contained not the body of Mr Asman, but that same waxwork... ...the coroner from Scotland Yard who investigated, Dr Sithe, would have noticed immediately. And yet she submitted this autopsy report for the victim, which the court has seen earlier. Why?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Because the waxwork was that of the Professor, is that what you're saying?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dr Sithe put her name to a document confirming the death of a condemned criminal who was still alive. A criminal whose apparent 'resurrection' was witnessed by Mr Drebber. But that misconduct was a deadly secret the coroner would do anything to protect. Which is precisely why Mr Drebber used that particular waxwork as the body double!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Aaaaaargh...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My Lord! This court must summon Dr Sithe to the stand! The defence is determined...to find out exactly how the coroner and Mr Drebber are connected!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But according to the missive I received this morning through the Prosecutor's Office... ...Dr Sithe is unable to participate in these proceedings. Is that not the case?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
She told us so herself, didn't she?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sithe:<br />
Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.

Let Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe...both take the stand together.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Very well, I will uphold your request. Bailiff! Send a subpoena with immediate effect, addressed to Dr Sithe of the Forensic Investigation Team. The woman is compelled to attend on Her Majesty's orders!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright then. Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe... If they weren't colluding with one another, this crime could never have been committed. I'm just a stone's throw away, I can feel it. The truth behind all of this is about to come out!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Thank you for your attendance at such short notice... Dr Sithe.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I'm disappointed in you, Lord van Zieks. You've completely betrayed the agreed policy of both Scotland Yard and the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Betrayal is not in my nature...as long as the truth isn't compromised. If it is... If there's even a hint of wrongdoing...then no matter whom it concerns or disgruntles... ...I will pursue the matter to the bitter end. As would any prosecutor worth his salt.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Drebber... ...you took the victim's life by means of a machine that you constructed in your workshop.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And Dr Sithe... ...as the investigating coroner, you were the first on the scene to examine the victim's body. It is the belief of the defence... ...that you collaborated with each other and were <span style="color:#E16935">both complicit</span> in this crime.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
And where's your evidence?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At present, we have no definitive evidence. But we do have a very significant clue.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm talking, of course, about the waxwork! This model of the killer known as the Professor...who was sentenced to death ten years ago.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
You don't need to tell me. I witnessed the man's execution with my own eyes. And officially pronounced him dead.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That remains to be seen.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Is that so?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to newspaper reports from the time, on the night following his execution... ...the killer came back to life.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Tsk! Don't waste my time!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And the sole witness to that mysterious event... ...was you, Mr Drebber, wasn't it?

If what you saw in the graveyard that night ten years ago wasn't some chilling fiction, but reality... ...it would make you privy to a very great secret of Dr Sithe's. A secret so profound, it could compel the coroner to agree to <span style="color:#E16935">collaborate</span> in your evil scheme, in fact.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Drebber, tell the court! Tell everyone the truth of what you saw that night in Lowgate Cemetery!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p>
<center>So he was the student who saw it...<br />
<p>You can see the resemblance actually, can't you? With the man in Madame Tusspells, I mean.<br />
Surely he's not going to claim that's really what he saw. Especially not after all these years.<br />
He was a research student at the University of London, was he?<br />
And a bit too clever for his own good, if you ask me...
</p>
Kuh kuh kuh...</center>
<p><br />
Drebber:<br />
What an <span style="color:#E16935">interesting</span> twist.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
When at the time, <span style="color:#E16935">not one person</span> would take me seriously. Yet now here we are, ten years later, and suddenly my story matters. And in <span style="color:#E16935">a court of law</span>, too. Very well, then. If everyone so <span style="color:#E16935">wishes</span>. Let's be <span style="color:#E16935">frank</span>. I'll tell you the truth of what happened that night...for what it's worth.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />

</p><p>Drebber:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, Mr Drebber... ...your testimony, please. About the events of that night ten years ago. You will tell the court exactly what you stumbled across in Lowgate Cemetery!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Yes</span> of course. As you wish.

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- In The Cemetery Ten Years Earlier -</span></center>
<p>Drebber:<br />
The reason I was in Lowgate Cemetery at all ten years ago was for...a spot of <span style="color:#E16935">moonlighting</span>, shall we say?<br />
Yes, the illustration in that newspaper article was based on <span style="color:#E16935">what I witnessed</span> that night.<br />
But thinking back now, I realise that I <span style="color:#E16935">never actually saw</span> the Professor.<br />
Soon afterwards, I was visited by <span style="color:#E16935">a young woman</span> who sculpted a model of me from wax.<br />
Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all <span style="color:#E16935">because of</span> that newspaper article.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait a minute! You're, you're claiming you didn't actually see the Professor now?!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Of course. You'd have to have a screw loose if you believed a corpse could <span style="color:#E16935">come back from the dead</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But... So you're saying this article is...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...<span style="color:#E16935">Not worth the paper it's printed on</span>? I think that would describe it perfectly, yes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If the details in the article aren't true... ...it nullifies your argument for why Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe would have been working together.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he's discrediting himself to cripple my argument?!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Tell me, witness... ...you claim to have been in the cemetery on some... <span style="color:#E16935">auxiliary business</span>. Can you elaborate?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
That's right. <span style="color:#E16935">Graverobbing</span>, to be precise. As you know, Lowgate Cemetery is at <span style="color:#E16935">the rear</span> of Barclay Prison. So among students at the university, it had a reputation for being haunted by <span style="color:#E16935">the ghosts of condemned convicts</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
G-Graverobbing, you say?!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses <span style="color:#E16935">to sell</span> is reasonably lucrative. Of course, I <span style="color:#E16935">never laid a finger</span> on any valuables buried with the dead.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So you were one of the so-called Resurrectionists. A particularly unpleasant scourge on society. 
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Actually, my fellows and I went by another name: '<span style="color:#E16935">The Repurposers</span>'.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, well...I think <span style="color:#E16935">I suffered</span> retribution enough. <span style="color:#E16935">The Daily Circus</span>...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to <span style="color:#E16935">leave the university</span>. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me <span style="color:#E16935">unambiguously</span>, I might add.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Out of interest, who drew the illustration for this article?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Ah yes, that was <span style="color:#E16935">the reporter</span> who exposed me. He sketched that right in front of me as I described the scene. Obviously, as time ticked on, I <span style="color:#E16935">bitterly</span> regretted what I'd done. Claiming to have seen something I <span style="color:#E16935">never truly saw</span>... Foolish. Very foolish.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Well, Counsel for the Defence...you may proceed to the cross-examination now.

At once, My Lord.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
By 'moonlighting', you mean graverobbing, do you?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Surely you only need to look at the graveyard scene and <span style="color:#E16935">my appearance</span> to gauge the answer to that?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The lantern and spade...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But who on earth would want to buy a dead body?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Any major hospital.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A hospital?!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
In order to better understand the human body, the study of anatomy is crucial to medical science. But there isn't a hospital in the world that has enough 'specimens' to work with. ...Though obviously they can't openly express an interest in obtaining more by dubious means.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
As aspiring scientists, we <span style="color:#E16935">young research students</span> had no money to work with, as I'm sure you can imagine. So we made <span style="color:#E16935">surreptitious arrangements</span> with a hospital via some of our medical student acquaintances. We would never take anything of value from the graves. This was all for <span style="color:#E16935">the furtherance of science</span>, you see. That's what <span style="color:#E16935">we all told ourselves</span> every time we stole into the graveyard at night, spade in hand.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You realise body-snatching is a serious crime. If you were caught, you could expect the gravest of consequences.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
We students were caught between the hammer and the anvil. We <span style="color:#E16935">needed funds</span> for research.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Professor Harebrayne said exactly the same...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm quite speechless at the apparent levity with which you've revealed this abhorrent behaviour.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well, if you wanted to know why I was there at <span style="color:#E16935">Lowgate Cemetery</span>, that's the reason. But I never expected it to end the way it did. That...I <span style="color:#E16935">regret</span> to this day.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The strange happening at Lowgate Cemetery...which you now deny.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Not entirely. I ran to fetch <span style="color:#E16935">the police</span> at the time, you know. I was shaking like a leaf. But they didn't believe a word of it. In fact, I was very nearly <span style="color:#E16935">arrested</span> myself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you went to the papers instead?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I started big, with the London News. But <span style="color:#E16935">unsurprisingly</span>, they didn't want to know, either. In the end, though, it was reporters from the <span style="color:#E16935">gossip</span> rags, the gutter press, that came to get my story. And it spread like the plague through the capital, as gossip-hungry <span style="color:#E16935">Londoners</span> lapped up the tale.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The story was in every single paper at the time, with the exception of some broadsheets.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
And yet <span style="color:#E16935">only two or three</span> of them actually interviewed me personally. Most of the accounts turned out to be very...interpretive <span style="color:#E16935">ghost stories</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What about the article in the Daily Circus?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
That particular <span style="color:#E16935">journalist</span> found me at my dormitory. I don't know how, but he'd discovered <span style="color:#E16935">my name</span>. So I recounted to him exactly <span style="color:#E16935">what had happened that night</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And from your description, he drew this illustration?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Precisely. That's how I learnt that the condemned man was the <span style="color:#E16935">infamous</span> Professor. Because the reporter told me so. I had no idea <span style="color:#E16935">myself</span>, you see.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Newspaper reporters are wont to snoop around in matters that don't concern them. So the scene portrayed in the illustration is accurate, then?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I think I explained <span style="color:#E16935">already</span>, didn't I? Lowgate Cemetery is at <span style="color:#E16935">the rear</span> of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by <span style="color:#E16935">the ghosts of condemned convicts</span>. For some absurd reason, I was <span style="color:#E16935">scared</span> of the graveyard at night. And as a result...only too willing to believe that <span style="color:#E16935">nonsense</span> about the dead coming back to life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But you said you actually <span style="color:#E16935">saw</span> it.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I said what I'd seen <span style="color:#E16935">in my mind's eye</span>. After all...resurrection is <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span>, isn't it? You'd have to be unhinged to think otherwise. Unless of course... ...you have some <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> that proves I encountered the Professor that night?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't know. Is there any material evidence that could show he really did see the Professor?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If we have anything at all, Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know. I need to present it against that irritatingly backtracking statement of his!

The point is, that night was <span style="color:#E16935">a pivotal moment</span> in my life.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, Mr Drebber, but I don't believe that.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Don't believe <span style="color:#E16935">what</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your latest claim. You <span style="color:#E16935">did see</span> the Professor on that night ten years ago.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Hm, oh dear, we seem to be at odds. But I was there. And you were not. I know what <span style="color:#E16935">I didn't see</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The illustration with this article... ...was drawn based upon what you told the journalist that you witnessed. A figure emerging from a tomb...wearing <span style="color:#E16935">an iron mask</span>.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes, when the killer was tried ten years ago... ...it was decided in the closed court's ruling that the man would wear the mask to hide his identity. It wasn't to be removed even during his execution and subsequent burial.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Not even the prison wardens were to see the man's face. But obviously, the provision of this mask was not public knowledge.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, Mr Drebber, as you've just heard...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Agh</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...a lowly student of the University of London certainly wouldn't have known about the condemned man's mask. So unless you'd actually seen the Professor that night... ...it's inconceivable that the artist would have included the mask in that illustration!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Aaaaaargh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Drebber?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... It's <span style="color:#E16935">a vile scene</span>, isn't it? If you look closely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
And as I've already been at pains to point out, I was utterly <span style="color:#E16935">petrified</span>. Which is why I had it in my head that I'd seen such <span style="color:#E16935">a blood-curdling sight</span>. But afterwards, I came to my senses. And realised that I'd been <span style="color:#E16935">mistaken</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You... You're still saying you didn't see it?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If you're stubbornly sticking to that story, witness... ...then amend your testimony to explain exactly how you think your eyes deceived you.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Of course</span>, of course. Only too happy to oblige.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A fellow graverobber? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well, I wasn't the only one busy in the cemetery that night, you know. Other <span style="color:#E16935">body snatchers</span> were at work. Of course, when I saw one emerging from the hole he'd dug, my heart very nearly <span style="color:#E16935">stopped</span>. So that's the terrifying sight <span style="color:#E16935">I actually saw</span>, you see.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You're claiming it was just another student on equally insalubrious business as yourself?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Many of the medical students would wear metal masks to <span style="color:#E16935">protect them from bacteria</span> during dissections. Clearly the fellow was using such a mask to <span style="color:#E16935">protect his anonymity</span>...wouldn't you say?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But there's more to the story, isn't there? The article goes on to say: 'In the next second, a gunshot rang out suddenly from behind. The bullet pierced the resurrected man's chest, whose breath then stilled once more.'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We might assume that the sexton discovered the miscreants at work, perhaps? And fired upon one of them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If a gravedigger had shot someone in the cemetery, I think it might have been rather big news, My Lord.

......... I thought it was a little strange, that is all. How Monsieur Drebber could claim this now.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
If you don't mind me saying, madame... <span style="color:#E16935">What are you talking about</span>?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Well, when I met you ten years ago at your university dormitory... ...you recounted to me about your adventures in the cemetery, non? Including the gunshot...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Stop</span>! You might want to <span style="color:#E16935">watch your tongue</span>, you know!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Have a care, Drebber. That's no way to speak to a lady.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Grrr</span>...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please, Madame Tusspells, carry on.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Of course. According to what Monsieur Drebber told me at the time... ...he did hear a gunshot from behind him, and the bullet hit the condemned man.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I said <span style="color:#E16935">nothing of the sort</span>!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Non, you were very explicit about the details. About the mask that the figure was wearing... ...and <span style="color:#E16935">the blood that splattered</span> over you when he was shot.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Enough! Shut up, woman! You're <span style="color:#E16935">making all this up</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That will do! Mr Drebber...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Hm? <span style="color:#E16935">Yes</span>?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You refute the account just given by Madame Tusspells?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... I have <span style="color:#E16935">no recollection</span> of ever saying those things.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Come on! Do you really expect us to believe you?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Control yourself, Counsel. I will not permit baseless accusations in my courtroom.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Under the circumstances... ...I think it best that you supplement your testimony with a statement to clarify your position on this, witness.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
V...Very well.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
An embellishment?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
As I explained earlier, <span style="color:#E16935">most</span> of what the papers published about those events was fabricated nonsense. The journalists had a great time fashioning it into a horrifying ghost story.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...now you're saying there was no gunshot?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">That's right</span>, yes. I'm afraid so.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I <span style="color:#E16935">mistakenly</span> thought I'd seen a corpse coming back to life and then fled the scene. That's really all that happened.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yet Madame Tusspells has testified that you told her about both of those details.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Not true. I <span style="color:#E16935">said nothing of the sort</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ten years have passed. Without material evidence to the contrary, you have no grounds on which to question the witness's word.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! Tell me, Madame Tusspells...
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Oui?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...what exactly did Mr Drebber say about the blood that apparently spattered on him?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Alors, this is what he told me: All of a sudden, he heard a very loud gunshot from behind his back. The bullet hit the figure who was emerging from the tomb in the middle of the chest. In his heart.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... One dreadful sight after another...
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
And since Monsieur Drebber was at that time facing towards the condemned man... ...the blood sprayed from the wound and spattered on his body. That is what he told me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...not an experience you would ever forget, is it?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Precisely. And <span style="color:#E16935">I didn't forget it</span>. Because, as I've already said... ...it <span style="color:#E16935">never happened</span> in the first place.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's clearly lying. If only I had some evidence to prove it...)</span>

And carelessly let slip that night after night, I was digging up graves. <span style="color:#E16935">Hardly a model student</span>, you might say.

This kind of camera is rarely seen in our homeland, so my colleague and I were keen to examine it closely. We noticed that the lens extends forwards on the end of some bellows... ...like this.

What's that? There...just on the bellows... It looks like...a dark red <span style="color:#E16935">stain</span>...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Ah</span>...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. It's a rather conspicuous mark here on the bellows, in fact.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord! Are you suggesting...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord. It would appear to be a spatter of <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Something that could be confirmed with a simple chemical test. Isn't that right, Dr Sithe?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
...! It would be difficult to determine if it was human blood and not the blood of some animal. But yes, to test whether or not it's blood at all is simple enough.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I propose that Madame Tusspells's testimony was correct. And that on the night in question ten years ago...you were spattered with blood from the gunshot wound.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well I...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that furthermore...you really did witness the condemned Professor emerging from his tomb!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Grrr... Gaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's simply no way you could have forgotten such a traumatic experience! In other words, the only explanation... ...is that you're trying to hide the fact that you saw the Professor that night!

Once a man is sent to the gallows, he hangs. No one could escape. Not in Great Britain.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the fact is...there was a witness to the fact that the man did escape his hanging!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If that were really true, Counsel, the implications of misconduct would not stop at the supervising coroner. It would taint the honour of the entire judiciary, from the ground up!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And it's exactly because of those monumental repercussions... ...that Dr Sithe would consent to any demand made of her by someone who threatened to expose the secret. Even if that meant being complicit in a crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You, you mean...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I mean that Dr Sithe wasn't collaborating in Mr Drebber's wicked scheme... ...she was <span style="color:#E16935">coerced</span> into collaborating! In order to protect her decade-old secret... ...she switched the dead body of Mr Asman with the waxwork model and fabricated the autopsy report!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
L-Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Pray forgive my freshly filled hallowed chalice...and a whole raft of other discourtesies now.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness me!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's just the sort of tall tale Londoners would enjoy, I grant you. An executed killer rising from the dead... A Scotland Yard cover-up... A conspiracy at the highest levels... So let me ask you one thing...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's that?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If the condemned man really did emerge from his tomb that night only to be shot in the chest... ...who pulled the trigger and disposed of him forever?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uh, well... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I have no idea at the moment!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We have too little information to work that out at present, I think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I couldn't agree more...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The Old Bailey is no place for wild fantasies.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And have you considered this, my learned Nipponese friend?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Considered what?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Do you realise just what a <span style="color:#E16935">dangerous</span> endeavour it would be to coerce this woman into such criminal activity? It's tantamount to declaring war on the entire British police force and judiciary.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Quite. Hard to imagine any sum of money being offered for research could warrant it.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
To rely on some stage deception when so much is at stake would be madness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, well I suppose...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And this was no petty crime, either. The victim was murdered. A man who'd already invested money in the venture, and would be instrumental in future profits, too.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, I had <span style="color:#E16935">no reason</span> to kill Mr Asman at all. Or are you forgetting that his death results in me receiving <span style="color:#E16935">not a single penny</span>? The court is <span style="color:#E16935">already aware</span> of the contract between myself and the victim, no?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... There is the contract, that's very true...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(The motive for this case runs deep, though. I can feel it.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Using threats to force the head of the Forensic Investigation Team to cooperate is extreme. Especially for a government grant he had no guarantee of receiving in the first place.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...If the research grant was the aim, taking Mr Asman's life would have made no sense anyway. Which means... ...Mr Drebber's motive wasn't money at all. He was...just trying to kill Mr Asman! <span style="color:#0070C0">(But why? What WAS his motive, then?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Your time is up, my learned friend. I'd say you have one last chance before the jury lose their patience with this charade.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let's see if you can back up your heady proposal, shall we? How do you explain why this engineer would throw all caution to the wind and threaten his own country?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
At this point, I'm not prepared to listen to more of this outlandish conjecture without proof. So, Counsel...present your evidence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright... Who exactly was Mr Asman to Drebber? There's <span style="color:#E16935">a connection</span> there that no one's seen yet. And I'm going to have to present <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> pieces of evidence to show what it is.)</span> Yes, My Lord. <span style="color:green">The evidence that establishes a motive and explains why the witness wanted the victim dead is right here!</span>

What these two pieces of evidence have in common... ...is a signature.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A, a signature?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The signature on the illustration that accompanies the ten-year-old article and the signature on the contract... ...belong to <span style="color:#E16935">the same person</span>!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Agh...............
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As the court has heard, this illustration was drawn ten years ago... ...by the newspaper reporter who found Mr Drebber and interviewed him about his ordeal. If you look closely, the reporter's signature can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the drawing.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And if you look at the contract here, which was signed between the witness and the victim last year... ...you can clearly see Mr Asman's signature at the bottom.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let me see now... Good Lord, yes! They're identical!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In short... ...the journalist who drew the illustration and wrote the article published about Mr Drebber ten years ago... ...was the victim of this case...Mr Odie Asman!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But explain to the court why! Why would that constitute a motive for the witness to murder Asman?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, if you think back... ...you'll remember that Mr Drebber talked about that article in his testimony.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
G-Graverobbing, you say?!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses <span style="color:#E16935">to sell</span> is reasonably lucrative.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, well...I think <span style="color:#E16935">I suffered</span> retribution enough. <span style="color:#E16935">The Daily Circus</span>...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to <span style="color:#E16935">leave the university</span>. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me <span style="color:#E16935">unambiguously</span>, I might add.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Drebber:<br />
Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all <span style="color:#E16935">because of</span> that newspaper article.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At the time, you were a student of the University of London who dreamt of becoming a scientist. However... ...this single newspaper article changed your entire life.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So Mr Asman used to be a newspaper journalist, did he?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He did, My Lord. In fact, it's a widely held belief that Asman managed to position himself at the heart of his criminal network... ...thanks to the many dubious connections he made during his time as reporter.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you had to give up on your dream and leave university. You lost everything. Eventually you found yourself working in the field of science, but only in the shadows. And all because of that article...written by Mr Asman!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
ENOUGH! ......... Stop this endless drivel about my life!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Explain yourself, Mr Drebber!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, it's true. I had to leave the university as a result of that article. But it was just the straw that broke the camel's back.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Almost every student of science in the faculty was too poor to actually conduct any research. But they struggled on with their hypotheses anyway. We all did. Only to have them taken by vultures. Sooner or later, you knew your ideas would be stolen and patented by some wretch or other, after all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Making a name for yourself as a scientist in a climate like that... ...was a miracle only a select few geniuses could ever hope to achieve. Personally, I wasn't one of those geniuses. So it was hardly a wrench. Being forced out of the university because of Lowgate was the best thing that could have happened to me!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
GOOD LOOOOOOOOORD!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Dr Sithe! Do you realise what you're saying, woman?!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... It's all true. That day... ...when I arrived at the Crystal Tower and saw the birdcage... ...my heart nearly stopped beating. That memory from a decade ago that I'd done my best to bury deep inside myself... It was the Professor again, staring me in the face. And then, before I had a chance to react, I noticed something else. There was a note tucked inside the model's jacket.
</p><p>'Dr Sithe, You will go along with my plan. From someone who knows the truth about what really happened that night ten years ago.'<br />
.........
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
All the instructions were there in the note. Every detail was meticulously written out. I had no choice but to do what it said. I made the necessary 'alterations' to the scene and fabricated the autopsy report as instructed. There was really no other choice. It had to be done to protect the judiciary. ...I can only apologise now.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Why on earth would you buckle now?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... Well there's no point trying to hide it any more, is there? I would have done anything to stop it coming out. Even collaborate in a murder. But the great lie about that execution ten years ago has been exposed. Whatever happens...I'm finished.

Wha...?!

</p><p>Drebber:<br />

Nnn...NOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Whatever this man says, I admit everything. He threatened to expose my secret, so I went along with his plan. And Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I hope you'll accept my apologies. ...What happens next is in your hands, of course.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I have heard more than enough now. I hereby present the final findings of this court.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This trial is not the proper forum in which to pursue the alleged wrongdoings of Mr Drebber. The defendant is Professor Albert Harebrayne.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Very true. It had slipped my mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Isn't he one of your closest friends?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As the court has heard, Dr Sithe has admitted to the allegations brought by the defence... ...thereby absolving the defendant of any possible guilt.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! You, you mean...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
At the present time, it is the conclusion of this court that the defendant was <span style="color:#E16935">not involved</span> in any wrongdoing. Does the prosecution have any objection?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... ...None, My Lord.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo! You've proven Professor Harebrayne's innocence!

Without further ado then, the adjudication. Unless the prosecution or defence have any other matters to discuss?

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Is everything alright, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Like you said before, the way the trial is set to end now... ...the judge will certainly deliver a verdict of not guilty. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But is that really what we want? What the defence should be pushing for now is...)</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence objects to the trial ending at this time, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We demand...one final testimony!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
WHAT?! You do realise I'm about to adjudicate in favour of your client, I presume?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you playing at now, my Nipponese friend? Why would you want to obstruct the conclusion of the trial at this point? No defence lawyer in his right mind would do that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, what exactly are you thinking?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The truth - the whole truth - and a way to bring it all out into the open.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Right!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, in hindsight...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I'm sure Mr Sholmes knew. He must have deduced that this would happen.)</span> Yes, I'm here in court to advocate for my client. And to secure an acquittal.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Obviously.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that's not all. I believe that I have a duty to the court... ...to pursue the whole truth of the case until every last detail is laid bare!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that is why the defence calls for further testimony from Dr Sithe.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Testimony from me? About what?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
About the nature of your collaboration with Mr Enoch Drebber!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Hah! In case it's escaped your attention, I've already admitted to everything I did. The whole truth has already been revealed. So stop wasting everyone's time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
As His Lordship made very plain, your client will get the acquittal you wanted for him. There's simply no point protracting this business further with another tedious cross-examination.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Pray forgive my careless handling of that hallowed bottle. I slipped.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's what you call it?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-What is your objection, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution... ...also calls for supplementary testimony from the witness.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Don't be stupid!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If there is more to this case than has yet come to light... ...then I will join my learned friend in pursuing the facts until the bitter end.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
You'll what...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This is most irregular, to say the least. However, as the prosecution also calls for it, I will uphold the request. Dr Sithe, you will testify for the court... ...explaining the full extent of your involvement in the murder apparently committed by Mr Drebber.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I... ...Very well.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Waxwork Plot -</span></center>
<p>Sithe:<br />
It all began at the scene when I saw the waxwork and the note tucked inside its jacket.<br />
The actual body of the victim, as indicated in the note's instructions, was beneath the experimentation stage.<br />
The body had to be 'arranged' in certain ways to implicate the defendant...which was my job.<br />
I enlisted the help of the entire Forensic Investigation Team to dress the scene appropriately.<br />
The truth about the execution ten years ago is a state secret of the highest level. I had to protect it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So I was right: the stage and the machine were all specially designed for the deception.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
So it seems. And all meticulously prepared. You did well to see through it. You're a very shrewd boy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So kind of you to say...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And what about this autopsy report, then?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
All I did was record the location of the body as being in the Crystal Tower instead of under the stage.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's all...? That's a terrible corruption!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Only my team were aware of the deceit, and then only under my explicit instructions. Nobody else at Scotland Yard knew anything about it, I assure you.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...we must be thankful for small mercies, I suppose. Well, I believe that testimony has clarified everything. There's no particular need for a cross-examination, I would say...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No, I disagree. I can't shake the feeling that something's wrong. Just look at that expression on Dr Sithe's face.)</span> It's the defence's right to cross-examine any witness following testimony!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Tsk! What is it about you Japanese that makes you all so doggedly persistent?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. If you so desire, Counsel, proceed with the cross-examination!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
From what you described before, it sounds like the note was anonymous. Did you have any idea of who was behind it?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
There are very few people in the know about what really happened ten years ago to start with. But anyway, I'd never heard of this engineer. So no, I had no idea.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yet despite not knowing who was behind the plan, you went along with it?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I had no choice. Protecting the Professor secret was my only concern.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But the horse has bolted now. And the stable door will never shut again. Scotland Yard's reputation will be immeasurably damaged as a result of all this.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Yes, thank you, Lord van Zieks. I'm well aware of that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, as I understand it, what you found in the birdcage was the waxwork model. Where, then, was the victim's body?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you knew about the special construction of the stage used to carry out the trick, then?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
It was quite obvious what had happened with the victim and the waxwork.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And you <span style="color:#E16935">switched</span> the two over, didn't you? In other words... ...you recorded the victim's body as having been discovered in the Crystal Tower. And the waxwork...?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I wrapped it and sent it by carriage to the specified address at the specified time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And why were you given such directions?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Presumably so it could be recovered by Drebber and returned to Madame Tusspells.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see. And then you put the birdcage back on the experimentation stage?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Yes. Although someone obviously made a mistake about which cage should go where. I thought I'd made it perfectly clear to the team, but still...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose you were focused on the victim's body, that being a more important detail.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When you say 'arranged', I presume you mean with this?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Yes. The instructions in the engineer's note said something along the lines of: 'Fabricate some evidence to make it clear that Harebrayne alone could have killed Asman.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you mean that was your doing?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I fetched Harebrayne's ridiculous screwdriver from the stage... ...and took it with me - alone - to the 'abyss' under the stage where the birdcage had fallen.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Alone, Doctor?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... I didn't feel it would be appropriate to involve anybody else in that particular part of the deception.
</p>
<center>There was a void under the stage where I found the birdcage lying in the dirt. I approached it, leaned down and slowly opened it up. Then I took the screwdriver in both hands... and plunged it into the man's chest!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
And then you noted that in your fake autopsy report... ...as a fictitious cause of death.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Exactly.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So the actual cause of death was...?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... The trauma resulting from the thirty-foot drop.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
My word...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What is it, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Something about Dr Sithe's last statement... ...is playing on my mind, that's all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...mine too. Dr Sithe!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
There's really no need to shout. I can hear you perfectly well.

So it was you who stabbed Asman with this!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Yes. Far easier than dissection, I assure you. No precision required.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What a welcome change...
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
The victim died instantly from a snapped neck. All I did was carry out the instructions I'd been given.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As unflinchingly as ever, no doubt. I imagine you didn't bat an eyelid when you drove the weapon into his body.

There was no need to bat my eyelids.

And what else did you do to twist the facts? Remind the court, why don't you?

Look closely at <span style="color:#E16935">the bloodstain</span> on the victim's chest. It clearly extends in a <span style="color:#E16935">downwards</span> direction, towards the man's feet.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And why is that significant, Counsel? If the victim was stabbed moments before the kinesis machine was set in motion, that's entirely expected... Aaaah! Of course, no, that's not what happened!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly, My Lord. Dr Sithe made it very clear in her testimony just now... ...that the point at which she stole Professor Harebrayne's screwdriver and stabbed the victim... ...was <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the grand deception was set in motion, when the birdcage had fallen below the stage out of sight. From the shape of it, it's clear that the birdcage would have <span style="color:#E16935">fallen on its side</span> after the thirty-foot drop. And if the victim had really been stabbed whilst inside the birdcage in that position... ...the blood from the wound would have spread out equally in all directions. For it to have formed the longitudinal appearance we see in the picture...is inconceivable!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Given that the victim's blood seeped vertically downwards from the wound... ...it must be the case that when you stabbed Mr Asman... he was <span style="color:#E16935">standing</span> up. In short, Dr Sithe... ...your latest testimony was a total fabrication!

Agh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH!

The answer is very simple if you consider the sequence of events. If, when the victim was stabbed, the blood from the wound seeped downwards, as it did... ...we can be sure that the victim must have been either <span style="color:#E16935">sitting or standing upright</span> at the time.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But as you rightly pointed out, the birdcage would have fallen on its side when it fell beneath the stage.

That's impossible! The man was dead, remember?

No! That is the misapprehension! When the birdcage fell from the stage into the void below, it must have hit the ground with considerable force.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... No, when you questioned what possible reason you could have for wanting to kill Mr Asman... ...something did come to mind.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
What?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What was it, Counsel? Enlighten the court at once!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, we saw it yesterday, didn't we? Something that seemed strange, but we had no reason to suspect it at the time...)</span> <span style="color:green">There's a particular object that explains why Dr Sithe would have wanted to kill Mr Asman!</span>

<p>Judge:<br />
Did you say 'scalpels'?!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
...Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It would appear that word has struck a chord, Doctor.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
You... Come on, out with it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was yesterday, when we visited your laboratory...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Look at this big thick book here.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, it appears to be an accounting ledger. It's a record of the Forensic Investigation Team's spending, I think. ......... Oh...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What is it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's clear that the team purchases various equipment and supplies on a monthly basis, but... Well, one entry seems rather strange.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? In what way?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
They're buying five hundred scalpels every month!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sithe:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Five hundred scalpels...a month?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At first, I wondered what on earth you could be using that many scalpels for. But actually, I realise now it's not the scalpels themselves that are significant. It's the money for them...disappearing every month from the department's accounts!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Asman's criminal organisation relied heavily on extortion for its funding. Tracing the money from the Forensic Investigation Team's account to find out where it was going... ...would be extremely straightforward.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Ugh...uuugh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ten years ago, when Mr Asman was still a journalist and wrote this article about Mr Drebber... ...he may well have stumbled upon information as he was researching the story. Information relating to Dr Sithe's darkest secret that he would use to rack money from her for the next decade.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Her darkest secret? Good Lord! You mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't know what happened on the night of that execution ten years ago... ...but clearly the opportunity to rid yourself of that menace was too tempting to pass up.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So in the end, you weren't coerced at all, were you? You did it entirely of your own free will. You stabbed Mr Asman in the heart with all your might... ...to silence the blackmailer who knew your dark secret forever!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
You'll never understand! None of you! What we've had to keep covered up all these long years...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As very little of the machine remains after it was ripped apart by the bomb... ...the truth of this case can never be properly established unless you speak out.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And if you decide not to... ...it's very possible that Courtney Sithe will escape punishment for her crimes. Please, sir...own up to what you've done and tell the court the truth about what happened!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ten years ago you told the truth...and you were robbed of a bright and successful future as a result. I can certainly understand your bitterness...and your consternation now. However... ...this is surely the chance you've been waiting for...to sever the hold that fate's had over you all these years.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... Super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis? I mean, really...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... It's the addle-brained mock scientists that are the worst, you know. They don't recognise the fact that they don't have talent. They can't even get that right. And so they end up chasing impossible dreams, having unbridled faith in their abilities. They go on and on about their wonderful hypotheses, their stupid eyes shining like a little child's. They make me sick! I can't abide their foolishness!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Careful, Mr Drebber.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... I was particularly pleased with the kinesis machine. It made for quite a show, didn't it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you admit it? You admit that it was nothing more than a sham made for the purpose of killing the victim?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, I admit it. I did it all...in the name of revenge.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Revenge for the future that Mr Asman's article had deprived you of ten years earlier. But the revenge you sought didn't stop at Asman, did it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Which is where that very particular waxwork comes in. Yes, I see...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The condemned convict that you saw rising from the grave in Lowgate Cemetery ten years ago... If your account of those events was all true...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Then obviously Scotland Yard couldn't afford to acknowledge what had happened. Even if it meant discrediting a bright young man and crushing any future career he might have had.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So your plan required that you abduct that particular waxwork model... ...in order to exact your revenge on Scotland Yard as well. Or on Dr Sithe, to be precise.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... It was a year ago... By some extraordinary twist of fate, Asman turned up at my workshop. He didn't remember who I was, of course. He just wanted to employ my services as an engineer. And he happened to have a paper with him. An article on the front page caught my eye. About the coroner who'd handled that bogus autopsy being appointed head of a new forensic team. ...When I learnt that news...my cognitive processes started to devise the plan.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What a horrid tale...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
He robbed me of my future, so I wanted to use the man's own wiles against him...for revenge. And have that rotten Scotland Yard eating out of my hand at the same time. I wanted them all to suffer the same humiliation I'd had to suffer!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your actions against those who'd ruined your future were justified as revenge. At least, to yourself. Certainly, no one has the right to destroy another's prospects, especially for purely selfish gain. And yet... ...in carrying out your plan, you did exactly that to someone else, didn't you?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Did I...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Professor Harebrayne's only crime was passion for his hypothesis! But you had no compunction about sacrificing his future to effect your revenge. You knew that he would be forever branded a failure and a fraud.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps life treated you unfairly ten years ago, and others' misconduct left your life in tatters. But remember this... ...your own actions...resulted in exactly the same thing for another perfectly innocent young man!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... I... I... .........
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks, what of Dr Sithe?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
An immediate warrant for her arrest has been granted and she's been remanded in custody, My Lord. I presume she will face trial in the coming days, along with Mr Drebber.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... A most regrettable situation indeed... She's made great contributions to her profession over the years. It really is a hard truth to swallow. However...that is a topic for some future occasion. For now, Professor Harebrayne...
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Oh, um...yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It seems there was a great deal more to your experiment than you realised. However, I think we can assume now that all the sordid details have been brought to light. This has been a very long and profound trial, but I'm pleased to say...you are absolved of all guilt.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... This whole experience has taught me a very great but painful lesson. I've, I've been... I mean, me, this dedicated scientist... This, this devotee of natural philosophy... I've been selfish and self-centred and above all...a fool.
</p><p>Ryunosuke;<br />
Professor...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I've spent my life thinking of nothing but my research. Misguidedly believing that I could do whatever I set my mind to, despite my lack of talent. And the worst of it is, in the process, I've caused others pain and misery! Others who are far, far greater people than I...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No, Professor, that's not true.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Don't tar yourself with the same brush as Drebber. What happened was his doing and his alone. This outcome is his fate, not yours. ...You're not to blame in any way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And the derision with which he referred to you earlier... Calling you a fool... Talentless, even...
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The man has no idea. To believe in yourself and work your fingers to the bone to realise your dreams... That's laudable, not laughable. No one has the right to deride another for such choices.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Oh... Thank you, Barok.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Yes, My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It is this court's expectation that you find the defendant not guilty of the charge of which he stands accused. I presume there are no objections?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
None from me, My Lord.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Certainly not.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
This trial has really made me think. But...this is the right decision.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
It's all been proven methodically and rigorously. I have no misgivings whatsoever.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Hm? What's that? Ee's done, is ee? It's all over?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I don't know what's become of the Yard these days. I don't recognise the place.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. In that case, I hereby pronounce the defendant...
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Court is adjourned!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's over... ...That was some trial.)</span>

Professor! What a splendid outcome, isn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, it is, it is! Congratulations, Professor Harebrayne!
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... Mr Naruhodo... Miss Susato... I am truly...truuuly... ...beside myself with gratitude! How can I ever thank you enough?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm just glad it's all been cleared up. That you realise you were just caught up in a bad situation.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
AAAAAAH! Right now, you know...if I had that research grant money... AAAAAAH! I'd give the whole lot to you! Every penny!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...that's very kind, but...I'm just a student, so...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We don't need any financial reward. Your acquittal is more than enough.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Oh dear... Oh what can I do...? Aha! How about this? As a memento? The paper about my hypothesis is inside!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Well, just as a memento then. Thank you.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I've been wondering, Professor... ...what are you going to do now?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Oh, oh my... Yes... What am I going to do? My hypothesis and my great machine lie in ruins... But still, it's been too long since I was last in London, so perhaps I'll enjoy some sightseeing. I must explore the Great Exhibition whilst I'm here, too, and see if new inspiration hits me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, that's a wonderful idea, I-
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>I can't allow that.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
L-Lord van Zieks! What are you doing in here?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Barok!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'm sorry you had to go through that, Albert.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Well, if I'm honest...it, it was terrifying! You were like a great demon behind your bench there, snarling down on your prey!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... You're one of the few true friends I have. I couldn't leave it to anybody else to handle the prosecution...or the defence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Or <span style="color:#E16935">the defence</span>? Did, did I just hear that right?)</span>
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I always knew that you had my best interests at heart, don't worry. Ah, how about you show me around while I'm here in town? It's been a long time since we left university. We have a lot to catch up on.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Listen, Albert... ...in a few days, your acquittal will be made official. When that happens... ...you must head straight to Dover. I'll accompany you.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
What?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
From there, you'll cross the Channel and make your way back to Germany. I've already purchased the tickets.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
But, but no! Hold on a minute, Barok! What about the Great Exhibition? This is the chance of a lifetime for me! I want to look around.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No, no sightseeing, Albert. Give up on the idea.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Ugh... S-Sometimes it's hard to see any warmth in those eyes, Barok...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, Lord van Zieks... ...what's all this about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
A necessary precaution.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, I...think I understand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You do?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, Iris told me that when you met Lord van Zieks at his office some days ago... ...he asked how Mr Natsume was doing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's right! I remember being surprised at the time... and thinking it was nice of him to ask.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The point is...Mr Natsume is <span style="color:#E16935">still alive</span> and well! Even though it's been more than six months now since he stood trial with the Reaper as the prosecutor.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! You, you mean... ...the Reaper's influence doesn't stretch <span style="color:#E16935">overseas</span>?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Those in the Reaper's sights meet their ends days or sometimes months after their acquittal. That's been the pattern up to now.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But of course, we know that both Mr Natsume and Gina were completely innocent.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... True. And perhaps that governs the Reaper's actions. The truly <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span> are <span style="color:#E16935">spared</span>. But I don't want to take any chances with a close personal friend.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
B-B-Barok...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Like the moustached Nipponese...this man should leave the country without delay. That's why...I'm packing him off to Germany at once!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
R-Right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Does your friend-shaped package get any say in it...?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness! Was this your intention all along then, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(In court, where people think of him as the Reaper, this man seems absolutely merciless...and yet... ...sometimes I feel as though I don't understand him at all.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's time to go, Albert. Back to the prison for the time being.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Ah, yes, alright. Well then, Mr Naruhodo... ...thank you so much for everything!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not at all, Professor! It was a pleasure getting to know you!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Best wishes, Professor Harebrayne.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Well, once the dust has settled...you MUST come and visit me in Germany! Anyway, goodbye for now!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Now, my Nipponese friend...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Yes? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I thought you'd gone too...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...we have matters to discuss. Can you spare me some time?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You want to talk with me?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'll be waiting in the courtroom in ten minutes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well that was strange. For some reason I didn't get that sense of impending doom as he walked away this time. The enigma, Barok van Zieks... What does he want to discuss, I wonder? The answer awaits in the courtroom, I suppose. Here goes then...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">24th October, 4:58 p.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
So, are you satisfied? You saved a guileless scientist from a great injustice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...yes! I think so. I'm relieved, at least, that the man's innocence could be proven.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Anyway... ...I imagine you've been wondering where my animosity towards you Nipponese comes from.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well, at first I thought you just didn't like me. I imagined you saw me as a pretentious child from an unimportant land, who had no business being here. But now I think differently.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You clearly know our ways. So I would guess that some specific incident led to your thorough dislike of my race. Will you tell me what happened, please?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... The Professor... I thought I'd never hear that name in this courtroom again, to be honest.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He, he took your brother's life...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Klint. My brother was Klint van Zieks. Sixteen years ago, when I was still just in my teens... ...he was already the Director of Prosecutions, and a key member of the judiciary. I looked up to him. He was everything I aspired to be.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He was involved in the establishment of justice systems in foreign countries, as well. There were exchange programmes between Britain and other nations then too, to share knowledge and ideas. As part of one of those programmes... ...three judicial students came to Britain from your homeland, the Empire of Japan.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! If it was sixteen years ago, then...one of them could have been my father...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Of course, I remember Doctor Mikotoba well.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I had no idea...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I was a minor at the time, training at the Prosecutor's Office. One day Klint introduced me to the three visiting Nipponese.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So...you've actually met my father...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He and his colleagues were polite and amicable. They were adept at their work and exacting in their standards. It was my first encounter with the Nipponese spirit, and it made a very great impression upon me. But six years later... That's when it happened. The investigation was going nowhere. There were no suspects, even. Just an ever-growing list of victims. And in the end...my brother became one of them. The last in fact, before the case was finally resolved.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm so sorry, Lord van Zieks. Truly...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Klint was always ready to put his life on the line for justice anyway. So he wouldn't have wanted it any other way. He lost his life to the killer, but it was his victory in the end. For me personally, though, it was a great loss. I found myself in a very dark place indeed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When I finally found out the killer's identity... ...the reason why no one had been able to catch the man sooner ceased to be such a mystery. He'd been <span style="color:#E16935">hiding in plain sight</span> all the time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In plain sight?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Are you aware of political events ten years ago? It was a period of extremely sensitive diplomacy between the British and Japanese empires.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A new treaty was being forged, I think?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Correct. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation was being concluded. The leaders of both countries were deep in extensive political discussions. Which is why this particular killer's appearance in court was conducted as a closed trial. If the British public had known the identity of the killer... ...not only would the treaty have been in jeopardy...but our two nations could very well have ended up at war.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! A, a war...between Britain and Japan?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But that would mean... Oh my! You mean to say the Professor was...

<center>...Until now...the thought never even crossed my mind... ...that the mass murderer whose crimes shook Britain as never before... ...was Japanese!</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>W-Wait a minute! That face... I feel as though...I've seen it somewhere... It's strangely familiar...</center>
<p><br />
???:
</p>
<center>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>...!</center>
<p><br />
???:
</p>
<center>Fa... Father...</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>...! Wha...? 'Father'? Kazuma! <span style="color:#0070C0">(My best friend, Kazuma Asogi... After a whole year... finally, his memories returned... ...as he stood there before me...)</span></center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Ryunosuke...</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Hello again... ...my friend.</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>Kazuma-sama!</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Judicial Assistant Mikotoba... ...it's been a very long road. Thank you. Thank you for guiding my friend here when I could not.</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>It...it was an honour.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>I knew you wouldn't die that easily, Kazuma.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>...I owe you thanks, too. ...for taking good care of that in my absence.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Hm? ...Oh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">Karuma</span>, the great blade of the Asogi clan, passed down through the generations... When we left Japan, this sword was at my friend's side. A Japanese man's katana is his soul. And he couldn't be parted from it. But then, when the incident happened... ...it was Susato-san's wish that I inherit the sword. And I've kept it with me ever since...along with my memories of the friendship we shared.)</span> With this by my side, I always felt that you were watching over me somehow.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>I've made it at last...Father.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Are you saying...? Surely not! You mean...y-you knew all this time?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm looking at it, but I still can't believe it... This mass murderer...is Kazuma's father!)</span></center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>K-Kazuma-sama...</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>......... Ryunosuke... ...we have much to talk about, but now is not the time. ...I'll be seeing you.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>That's all Kazuma said... ...before he turned and left us there in the courtroom.</center>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
So he's the living 'afterimage' of the man who took my brother's life, is he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Kazuma Asogi. My best friend.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Three months ago, when Lord Stronghart introduced us... ...I had an inkling there was something there. Some connection.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But why did Lord Stronghart do that? Why did he make Kazuma Lord van Zieks's apprentice? And when he was suffering amnesia, too...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The man was apprehended... Even executed... ...but his legacy just won't die. That's the sad truth. Anyway, that's all I had to say. I thank you for meeting with me as I asked.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Susato:<br />
Ten years ago... ...my grandmother took me to the railway station. We were there to meet my father from the train. For me... ...it was the first time I'd ever seen him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Susato-san. All this is tied up with painful memories for her, too. She's never talked about this with me before, though...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:
</p>
<center>It took time to adjust to having Father around. But just when I was starting to get used to it... ...he called me into his study one day. He told me that a great friend of his had passed away in London. And that the friend had left behind a son. A boy, seven years my senior. Father told me the boy had made a promise to his late father... ...so he was studying to become a defence lawyer.</center>
<p>I wanted to help, so... ...I studied to become a qualified judicial assistant. ......... As I'm sure you've worked out... ...that young man's name... ...was Kazuma Asogi. So you see...that's how he and I met.
</p>
<hr />
<p>For a brief moment, my great friend had returned... only to disappear again all too soon. But in that fleeting encounter, something stirred. Something that had been dormant for a long time. As if great wheels had been set in motion. I could almost hear them creaking into life. In some ways, it was the end of a chapter. But in many, it was the start of a new one.

Mr Drebber! Is something wrong?

Mr Drebber!

.........

It would appear his only answer is that rather bewitching mechanical wiggle.

...He could have just said no.

Dr Sithe!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You were clearly just lost in thought about something!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... Your jet-black Japanese hair.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
It made me wonder if perhaps your head was filled with equally jet-black Indian ink. And that the only way to know for sure, would be to cut your head open and see. That's what I was thinking.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, mental note in black sumi ink: never pursue Dr Sithe again.)</span>

Mr Naruhodo! You mustn't be intimidated!

Madame Tusspells!

Oui?

Is there something about that last statement that you'd like to remark on?

I am afraid to say that I am rather whimsical at heart.

Oh, really?

So when something bothers me, I pour hot wax over it first and think about it afterwards.
