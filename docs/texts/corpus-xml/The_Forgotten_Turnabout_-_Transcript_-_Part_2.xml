<title>The Forgotten Turnabout</title>
<line speaker="Ray">It's pretty dark down here... I can't see a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Watch your footing, Ema.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ouch! I think I hit my head...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, be careful not to slip. Take your time coming down.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah... OK!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hmmm... The light switch should be somewhere around here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th... This is! <thought>The hidden 51st floor... Is it being used as a storeroom? We'll need to investigate it thoroughly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth! Please tell me about the case!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right then, where should I begin...?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I see... This is certainly a serious situation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why does she look like she's having so much fun...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Heh heh heh... looks like you're in a bind, Prosecutorial Attorney Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I'm not a defense attorney. Nor is there such thing as a "Prosecutorial Attorney."</line>
<line speaker="Ema">This looks like a job for science! Don't worry. I've got everything here in my bag.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you sure you're up for this, Ema?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Of course! So, once again... ...it's good to be working with you, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And I'm glad to be working with you, as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Looks like we've got ourselves another cute assistant. ...So, what's the plan?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">That lift looks pretty suspicious to me!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It... looks like it goes down?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am curious as well... But first, we should investigate this room.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">OK. If you find out anything, be sure to tell Uncle Ray.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And if I remember something, I'll let you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, please do. ...Ema.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Roger! I'm ready to support!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well then... let's begin the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From the price tags attached to the pieces of evidence, and that huge stash of cash... ...it's clear that buying and selling of evidence was being carried out here.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">In the hidden 51st floor, evidence was being trafficked! This clearly means something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems further investigation is needed... ...about the dealings that went on in this place.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">If only there was a witness, we could just ask them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A witness...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ask me anything you want!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Since Kay's the suspect, I can't just stay silent!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I feel the same way. For now, we should calm down and search for clues.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">...No. After thinking it through scientifically, I've come up with an even better plan! I'll just give Kay an extremely powerful electric shock to her head... ...and see if that will jump start her memories!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... W-Well. That seems a bit, no, quite dangerous. I would prefer to go with my proposal to calm down and investigate this room.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Is that so? But in science, a bit of danger always comes with the territory...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not exactly what you would call "a bit of danger"!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">I came back here for a while as my teacher's translator, but normally I study in Europe. That's right! To become a super forensic scientist!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's admirable. Endeavoring to learn is the duty of a student.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Yes! In order to excel in both academics and athletics, I've even taken up sports. For example, the competitions they have during Sports Day!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Oh? I wonder what sort of competitions she's referring to?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Unlike America, Europe has extremely tough, manly sports, and... Well, I'm sure you've heard of the "War of the Eyeglasses" at least.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I've never heard of it before in my life...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">This is Kay's badge, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. This is her precious badge. ...Though she doesn't seem to remember it herself.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Is that so...? Hmm. Maybe it doesn't have enough impact? How about I customize that badge a bit? Let's spruce it up a little with pink ribbons and white feathers!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I appreciate the offer, but... let's keep it like this for now. <thought>Kay's memories would only become even more confused.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">I wonder why Kay lost her memories? Maybe she saw something really shocking...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... She seems to have gotten herself involved in a murder case, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I also went through some pretty scary things in the past, as well... ...but thanks to my sister and everyone else who saved me, I can be who I am today. Mr. Edgeworth! We're definitely going to save Kay, OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you like this sort of thing, Ema?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Well... Between the fabric, the texture, and the weight, I find this item quite fascinating! Judging from the damage to the fur, it would appear that this was made quite a long time ago!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm, didn't you say it was "cute" earlier...?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I do think it's cute. But that's a different matter entirely!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't understand how that's different at all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Scientifically speaking, I'd have to say that the details are unknown.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, in plain English... You don't know anything about it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">It's not that I don't know. It's just that the details! Are unknown!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-These are...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Wh-What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The items displayed on this shelf here, if I recall correctly... ...they're all evidence from past cases that I was involved with. What are they doing here...?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Hmm. I guess that would make this place the P.I.C.'s evidence storeroom, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These items should be kept in the care of the police.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Don't they keep evidence in the Prosecutor's Office?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Only for current trials. However, once a verdict has been reached... ...the evidence is transferred over to the police department, and stored in the evidence room.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">But it looks like the evidence has been stored here instead...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There's no point in worrying about it. For now, I should try examining everything.</thought> It looks like some of evidence have tags in front of them. And there are numbers written on the tags.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Maybe they're the ID numbers of the evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. Based on how large these numbers are and the nature of these items, I'd say... ...these are prices <thought>Prices - Prices are attached to the piece of evidence. They seem rather high.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">P-Prices! If that's the case... ...Wow! These are ridiculously expensive!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She seems more concerned with the high prices than the legality of this whole affair...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The evidence on display... I should inspect every nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">That's strange. Only this one spot is empty. But it still has a price tag, just like all the others...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Furthermore, there is a part of this cloth that is not covered in dust. Perhaps something was placed here not so long ago?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I see! It sure seems like it. Hmm, but... ...what could it have been?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This star-shaped mark in the dust. I wonder... Could it be related to a certain piece of evidence?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">The murder weapon was placed here, right? This storeroom... sure is a scary place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, Ema, at the same time... ...it also means this spot is deeply tied to the case.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">The spirit of inquiry is the cornerstone of science! Let's inspect every nook and cranny. ...Just not the scary places!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Awww, how cute! This stuffed animal is so fluffy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's from Gourd Lake. <thought>It should be in the care of the prosecutor assigned to that case right now... Why is it sitting here in a place like this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Huh? This little guy's missing his left horn!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. His left horn... I'm pretty sure it was already missing when I first saw it.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Then, this must be a defective product. I demand a recall!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Now that I think about it... ...giving a broken toy to a country's president does sound strange.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">This storeroom contains items to be sold, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's unfortunate, but the possibility seems quite high. I suspect some nefarious individual has been selling evidence here.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">And people actually pay money for this stuff?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Apparently, some people do. The price tags are proof.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Different strokes for different folks, I guess...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ink... and a lamp. Both are evidence that I've handled before.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Why is all this stuff here linked to you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Many of the items here are objects that I've handled just a short while ago. But it's probably only a coincidence that they're all collected here.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">A coincidence!? I never thought I'd hear you say that word, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No matter how improbable, if it fits with the facts, then we must accept it as the truth... Isn't that the same with science?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Aha! We should discuss science in detail some day, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">What a cute doll. It kinda looks like the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's the Iron Infant, son of the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess... He was destined to become a hero of justice from the moment of his birth. So much pressure rests on his tiny baby shoulders. And yet, he carries himself with a grace and dignity that belies a toddler of his age.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">...Hello! Mr. Edgeworth! Are you even listening to me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? O-Of course I am!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a small bottle. I've seen this piece of evidence before in the past.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">.....Huh? Is that all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uh. Yes. What more did you want me to say?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Umm, I need to make a memo. Note to self... Even the most boring objects sound like works of art when Mr. Edgeworth describes them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...! Don't read a memo like that out loud!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">This mannequin... I've got it! According to my scientific reasoning... ...this is something you encountered in one of your past cases, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No, it's not. This is the first time I've seen this mannequin. <thought>It seems completely unrelated to the other objects in this room. There's no price tag in front of this mannequin either. So then, why is it here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ema, please observe the state of this area.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Oh! Scientifically speaking, you've found something, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Wouldn't you say this spot is connected to the evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Hmm... I would say no, wouldn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>So it's not connected...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Let's have another good look at this area! Surely, there must be something that sticks out to you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something that sticks out... Perhaps if I compare it to the evidence I hold.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This dust pattern... matches up perfectly with the base of the candelabra! It's likely that the killer got the candelabra from this very storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Does that mean... the candelabra was also a piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's quite possible. However, that is not the issue here. The murder weapon originally came from this storeroom. We must keep that in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Don't you think it's kinda creepy how all these masks are lined up in such a dark place?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Ema, are you not good with horror movies?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">N-N-N-N-No way! Horror movies are so unscientific.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...So she's scared of them.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Th-This mask is...! ...the Mysterious Global Hero... Onyankopon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are you so surprised?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth, don't you know? Everything about this show is shrouded in mystery! From he production company to the broadcast times... Even the merchandise is hard to find!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wouldn't that mean... the company simply went bankrupt?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">It's Captain Saipan! He's really popular in Europe. All the kids, and even the adults, dress up like him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I think the flower on his head would be a little too much.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">What TV show are these masks from?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not very familiar with it, but... I believe it's called "The Students of the Starry School." Each member of the class is a hero of justice.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">So I guess those red and white caps are a part of their school uniforms! And maybe the number of eye slits on the masks corresponds to their class rankings? See, the one on the left is ranked Number 1, and the one on the right is Number 2, and so on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh... I see. So that's how it works.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">If that's the case, the student with the lowest rank would have a mask full of holes...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I guess we'll have to watch the show to find out.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When you think of the heroines from the Steel Samurai universe, she's the first to come to mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">That's right! I love the Pink Princess too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ema, you watch this kind of show?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Yeah, of course! You like it too, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! No, I... wouldn't go that far.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Really? Since you had a Steel Samurai figure in your office, I thought for sure...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh... So even Ema has noticed it...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Various masks are placed here... There's even one of the Steel Samurai. <thought>Indeed, these are... fairly high-quality replicas.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Scientifically speaking... it's just a bunch of random masks!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It certainly does look like a hodgepodge collection of masks. Hmm, this hook is...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">It looks like a hook to hang a mask from.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wonder what mask used to be here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Steel Samurai, Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, and the Nickel Samurai...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">The Nickel Samurai always seemed kinda smug by comparison. And his slender build doesn't look cool at all! I definitely prefer the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Hm. It seems she has good taste.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These are...! Murder case files!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ehhh!? Wh-What are those doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By all rights, they should be kept at the Prosecutor's Building or the courthouse, but... ...it would seem that someone has removed them. <thought>Something is afoot, and we are none the wiser...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ema, what do you think about this piece of evidence, and this area?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Hmm... Scientifically speaking, I'd say they're not connected at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nwargh! <thought>That was fast.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth. Please look over this area again. Doesn't it feel like something is missing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something is missing...? Do I have any idea as to what this missing item could be?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Jammin' Ninja mask that Kay had with her... Perhaps it was originally attached to this hook!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">That sounds plausible. Scientifically speaking. In other words... Kay came here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's quite likely. But... for what purpose?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Maybe she was going to steal something from this place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A Great Thief who steals the truth, huh...</thought> No, I don't think we can answer that question at this time.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Scientifically speaking, this must be a wooden ice box. This chain is tied around it to keep the cold from escaping. Probably.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Ema... Wouldn't this be a costume trunk? It's made from wood that repels bugs in order to protect the clothes inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ah, I see. Of course! That's another possible theory. If your clothes are stored in a cold place, it would be nice and cool to wear in the summer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I guess she's sticking to her ice box theory.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">There's a transceiver sitting next to all these trophies.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems like they were lined up together on purpose...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Looks like it's still got batteries in it. Might come in handy later, so I'll pick them up for now... I'll be sure to put it to good use before I turn it in to the police.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That sounds just like what a certain Great Thief would say...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Wow... Talk about bad taste! I've never seen such a gaudy desk before! Just what kind of person would use something like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The table top is being supported by four naked men. The design is quite painful to look at. It certainly is in poor taste.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Maybe this is also related to one of your past cases?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. None of the cases I handled involved a person with such bad taste. <thought>...Or at least I hope not.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes? Can I help with something?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's a cute stuffed animal. ...Is it a bull?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It appears so. I found this at a crime scene with you just the other day...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">One of its horns is broken... So I guess even a stuffed animal can get injured... Ah...! My head, it hurts...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! What's wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">For some reason, looking at that stuffed animal makes my head...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... I'd better put this away for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Look, look. Check it out. This lift has a sturdy platform and solid steel supports! According to my calculations, it should be able to support the weight of 50 Mr. Edgeworths.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I doubt there is enough space for that many people. It seems to be used for moving goods.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I wonder about that. If you pack them in real tight, they just might fit. All 50 of them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Impossible. That aside, there are still some more places in this storeroom we need to examine. We'll examine the lift after we finish our investigation here.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Impossible, huh... Then how about 45! No, we might even be able to fit 48 people...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh man. Uncle Ray's heart is pounding up a storm! Surrounded by so many cutie-pies in such a small, cramped room!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Shields. Please try to be more serious.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Heh heh heh. It was just a joke. Uncle Ray's keeping a close watch over little Kay. So you can continue your investigation without worry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You watching over Kay is exactly what I'm worried about...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a huge stack of money piled up here. ...How unrefined.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">They're all 100 dollar bills! Talk about big bucks <thought>Big bucks - Stacks of cash found in storeroom. A big deal went down here.</thought>! So, how many times your yearly salary do you think this is worth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Leave my salary out of this!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">What's this? It looks like... a giant head!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If I recall, this is the head of "Mrs. Monkey." <thought>I believe it was from a case I was involved with in the past. It's impressive how they were able to get such a large object into this room.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Hrmm. "Mrs. Monkey", huh? That doesn't really have a nice ring to it. Maybe you remembered the name wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... I-Impossible. <thought>That can't be true!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This statue...!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Yes, is it some sort of new fact?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... this is evidence from a case that I was previously involved in. <thought>I believe it was called the "Alice Red" statue. There were supposed to be two of them, one real and one fake, but... ...no matter which one this is, it's unnatural for it to turn up in a place like this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth, you've really seen a lot of cases..... huh?</line>
<line speaker="???">Gotchaaaaaa! Yippee-ki-yay! I got me a scoooooop!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Eeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah... my eyes...! Stop it!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ya ain't gettin' away from the Great Lotta's camera that easily! I reckon y'all must be criminals! I'ma snap 16 shots before y'all can even say "Cheese!"</line>
<line speaker="Ema">We're not criminals!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">...Really? Ya ain't foolin' my camera of justice with those words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm, you are...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Huuh? Yer... Ain't ya that heinous prosecutor from back then!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who are you calling heinous!? <thought>This is Lotta Hart... She's a photographer I've dealt with during my past cases. I see her distinctive accent and her chatterbox mouth haven't changed a bit.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Just look at that face! Yer obviously up to no good!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems she has a bad impression of us.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Now it's time to pay yer dues! Stand still while I photograph y'all!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">We only came here to investigate...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Lies! Ya think ya can fool me like that?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">...Mr. Edgeworth. She's not listening at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...She seems harmless. Let's just leave her be, for now.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ask me anything you want!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Somehow, I get the feeling she doesn't like you very much, Mr. Edgeworth. She's even calling you absurd things like a heinous prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She's been involved with a few of my previous cases. Her turning up here was a bit unexpected, but let us continue with our own investigation. If we gather clues, and connect them with "Logic"... ...then the truth will come to me. That is my way of doing things. I won't let a "heinous journalist" get in my way!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">.....Umm, Mr. Edgeworth? Are you bothered by being called a heinous prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... M-Most definitely not!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I wonder what Ms. Hart came here to do? Armed with such a nice camera, it looks like she was after something.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We know that the trading of evidence had taken place here. There is a chance that what she was after may be related to that.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I really don't want to, but let's  hear what she has to say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Verily. I agree. <thought>Especially about the "not wanting to" part...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">So... what're all y'all folks doin' in a suspicious place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I was about to ask you the very same question. Why are you here?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">For the people of the world, and for myself! I'm a social justice photographer after all! So I gotta take photo after photo after photo for my big scooop!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems I won't be able to talk to her normally when she's like this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, why did you come here?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">For the people of the world, and for myself! I'm a social justice photographer after all!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">S-Social Justice...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then allow me to guess the reason why you came here. Was it perhaps to expose the illegal trafficking?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Oh, I get it. You were trying to get a scoop on the secret dealings!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">...H-Huh. Y'all know that much already? Well, I reckon there ain't no reason to hide it anymore... My sources tell me there's some kind of black market auction bein' held round these parts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you say!? So then, all this evidence here is...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yup, they're the goods for the auction. There's a lotta dirty money flyin' round here. I wanted to try and catch it with my own two eyes. My source gave me a whole buncha info, but... ...I figured just hearing about it ain't enough. Seein' is believein', after all. So I've been stakin' out the place from behind this here statue since yesterday. The auction took place late last night, and went on 'til the early mornin'.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A murder on the night of the black market auction. Could the two events be related...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y'all got somethin' to say?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Black market dealings in the Grand Tower!! Guess I really hit the mother lode this time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Were all the items in the auction pieces of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">There was some normal stuff too, like stolen art and the like.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wouldn't consider stolen art to be normal.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">But, I reckon the evidence was the star of the show here! These folks are law fanatics, tryin' to get their hands on the latest goods from the police.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">So that's what you wanted to get pictures of, Ms. Hart? Pretty much! They were meetin' right under this very storeroom. So I watched 'em from up here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said you were here since yesterday. Did you witness the entire event?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">It was a black market auction, after all. They followed a fairly detailed procedure. First, the participants entered the storeroom from the viewin' platform one at a time. When they got in, they each took one of those masks on the wall over there... Funny thing 'bout those masks... They're all equipped with voice changers. Itty bitty ones. That way they wouldn't be recognized. They wanted to protect their... "an anemone"?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">You mean... their "anonymity"?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yeah, that's it! Their "anomnintany"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why not just say "identity" and make things easier for all of us...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">After puttin' on the mask, they'd go down the lift, and the next feller would come right in. On the way back, it was the exact same thing, but in reverse. They'd come up one by one, return the mask, and head up outta the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Wow, that's pretty thorough.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. How many participants were there?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">11 people altogether. I counted each of 'em as they made their way down <thought>Auction participants - Entered the storeroom from roof one at a time. Exited the same way.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I'll have you know, I wasn't just laid up behind this statue the entire time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, where were you in the beginning?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">The beginnin'...? Well, don't you worry yerself about that, ya hear?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So she was hiding behind the statue the entire time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I watched the folks comin' in while lurkin' in the shadows... All secret agent-like...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Note to self: secret agents like to lurk in the shadows.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">And then, they used that lift over there to get down to the auction site. After they all went down, I watched the whole thing from the lift.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did that lift stay down the entire time?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Naw, it came back up. But there's a tiny gap in the floor there. There's a bit of space between the floor and the lift platform, ya see. So I could see just about everything that was goin' on down there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, did you see the person who was conducting the auction!?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Eh!? W-Well... yeah! You betcha, I did! What kinda story would this be if I didn't know who the "Conductor" was?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The Conductor, huh? It seems I'll need to ask her for more details.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have any more information about this so-called Conductor?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">........Ya know. I came here to get me a scoop. What makes ya think I'll give up my info to you all willy nilly!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Basically... what you're saying is, you don't know.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ah, I see. So that's why she won't answer!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">.....What can I say? I couldn't even tell how old they were, or if they were a guy or a gal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Can you tell me what the person was wearing at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">They had on a white jacket with a purple flower, and they were wearin' white gloves. But ya know, that don't mean much when I have no earthly clue who they really are.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">So the Conductor's identity was hidden, just like the participants?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's right! They had on a mask and voice changer, just like everyone else!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What kind of mask... did this person wear?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">It was... a "Zurvan" mask, I reckon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Zu... Zurvan...! What in blazes is that supposed to be...?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth! You don't know about Zurvan? He's the sworn enemy of Global Hero Onyankopon! "Zurvan, the Ruler of Time!" Seriously! Who hasn't heard of him!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Most people, I'd imagine...</thought> Since the Conductor wore a mask, I assume you were not able to see their face...?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Not even a teeny weeny bit! And after I came all this way for my big scoop... *sniff*... This whole story's turnin' out to be nuthin' but fool's gold.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That set of clothes seems familiar. Perhaps I should show her that piece of evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Th-That badge is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the genunine badge of the Yatagarasu. Perhaps we could trade some information...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Not a chance. The Yatagarasu ain't nothing but yesterday's biscuits. I need somethin' with more impact! That there badge won't stir up nothin' interestin'.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Stir things up...? Don't tell me you intend to spread false information?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Don't be draggin' my name through the mud. I just wanna spice things up a bit. ...Maybe dress it up a little and add some juicy bits here and there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You shouldn't compromise your stories with fabrications, Ms. Hart!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hmm. If I'm gonna make the news, I'll need to find out the Conductor's true identity.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That person wore a mask and a voice changer, right?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Along with a white suit and a purple flower. Aww, shucks! Was all this a waste of time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wouldn't say you wasted your time, Ms. Hart.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Collectin' info ain't easy! You gotta pay for film, and travel expenses... And after stakin' out the place for a whole day, I'm starvin'!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you are truly after a scoop, you should be willing to endure that much!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Lemme just say, if yer tryin' to grab my interest... ...ya gotta bring me something that actually smells like a scoop!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I guess this didn't catch her interest.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Earlier, you said that this was evidence from a case that you were involved with. At any rate, you've gotta admit that this is a very strange statue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the Alice Red statue.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">.....Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the Alice Red statue.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">But it doesn't look all red to me... Wait, the name is written here: "Alif Red" statue. Alif Red... All is Red. All is Red... Alif Red.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? What are you mumbling to yourself about over there?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">N-No! It's nothing. Come on, let's examine some other places!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>.....?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said the Conductor wore a white jacket with a purple flower, and white gloves?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's right. They sure looked spiffy for a criminal mastermind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hart, did they look anything like this?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Heeeey! That's it! That's the Conductor! ...H-H-Hold yer horses! Are ya tellin' me the Conductor is dead!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She is the victim of a case we are investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Her name is Jill Crane. Have you heard of her?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Can't say I have... So, she was a lady, huh. What kinda gal dresses like that? She get her kicks by foolin' me into thinkin' she's a guy!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I doubt that her intention was to deceive you... Setting that aside... We have established something of major importance. The victim was the Conductor of the black market auction.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I see... so the Conductor was killed. Then that might explain...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Explain what, Ms. Hart?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ah! N-No, no, no! It's nothin', honest!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ms. Hart... You clearly sounded suspicious just now.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">And I'm tellin' ya, I ain't! Hmm, can't be...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Sorry, were you trying to say something?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">No, I ain't! I ain't said nothin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Please don't be like that. Just tell us.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">How many times do I gotta tell y'all? I'm a journalist! Information is what pays the bills. I can't just go around spoutin' everything I know! I've already said too much! I got nothin' left to say to y'all!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Th-Then! What if I found some fingerprints for you?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Wh-What good would that do me!? I don't want none of yer dusty old prints! Why don't you two follow my example, and do some investigatin' on yer own!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ooh... I guess she won't tell us anything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not to worry, Ema. Just leave it to me. I have a certain method of drawing out information from those who wish to hide it. If my opponent's lips are sealed, I will be the one to unseal them. Let us begin.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">First, let's analyze my opponent's demeanor...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I ain't tellin' you nothin'! So quit wastin' my time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She seems rather impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation.</thought> I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses. I'm almost certain... that she's hiding something from me. That's where I'll begin my attack. Now, time for the first move!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want you to tell me everything that you know, right now!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Nooooo way, Jose! I ain't spillin' my guts to someone I have no connection with!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........  I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you think you're overreacting a bit? Let's just calm down and...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I'm always calm! Now leave me alone!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">A real journalist... always keeps her cool.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Speaking of journalists... I have something interesting to tell you. A few days ago, I met another self-proclaimed journalist. She spoke with an accent quite similar to your own...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">S-She spoke like me? Then, maybe it was...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Nicole Swift. She had a distinct way of speaking. One very much like your own. Furthermore, she said that she had a mentor... Could she have been referring to you?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">O-Oh! So you know Nicole? Weeell, ain't that a fun little coincidence! Where'd y'all meet? Wait... No, no! Stop tryin' to get me to spill the beans! Phew, that was a close call.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems that she lets down her guard when she talks about Ms. Swift. This could be a useful clue.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I should use that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You say I have no connection with you, Ms. Hart? But, don't we have a mutual acquaintance with your apprentice?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ulp! W-Well, that's... I reckon it would be mighty cruel of me... ...to give Nicole's friends the cold shoulder...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, why don't you share with us what you know?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, when ya put it like that... I guess I could let you in on my scoo... N-No! I ain't fallin' for your nasty tricks! No siree!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your "scoo"?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">N-No, just forget it. It ain't nothin' important...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Such a slip of the tongue... It's hardly becoming of a journalist. You have a scoop, don't you? Now, tell us what it is!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Aagh! A-Alright... Ya got me. I had me a perfect scoop... But I ain't tellin' you what it is! I'm gonna sell the story to a publisher!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The information she is hiding could be vital to the investigation. I need to make her talk. Next, I will press her on the contents of her scoop. She may be quick to lose her temper, but she's even quicker to loosen her tongue. She is not a different opponent. Now, to extract the information I need.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Does this scoop of yours have something to do with the black market auction?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya talkin' about...? I don't know nothin' about that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Weren't you in the middle of infiltrating the black market auction? The only logical conclusion is... that your story has something to do with it!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y-You ain't gettin' any answers from me. I... didn't hear nothin'.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't hear... What, exactly? Did you hear something during the auction?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Um, no, that's... I just heard a weird sound, is all. It ain't even worth mentionin' in my article. J-Just forget about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There's no question. Something happened during the black market auction. She heard a strange sound... This could be a useful clue.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Does your story pertain to an incident of some kind?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, maybe it does... And maybe it doesn't...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's hardly a clear answer!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Wh-Why're you always hollerin' at me...? I ain't done nothin' wrong... I just snuck in to do some investigate reportin'...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't do anything wrong? That's a bold statement... ...considering you're currently trespassing on private property!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">H-Hey! Yer doin' it too! Well... I guess a prosecutor's got the right to investigate wherever they please...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I probably shouldn't mention anything about the current state of my employment...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">There are far worse people in the world, ya know... *mumble* I reckon I'm a saint... compared to folks who murder...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Considering what you just mumbled... ...is it possible your scoop has something to do with a murder incident?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">H-Hey, I was... only talkin' in general terms just now! I mean, anyone'd look like a bag o' roses compared to a murderer, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It sounds like you're just making excuses to me...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">All I did was gather info on the black market auction! A murder incident? I don't know anythin' about that. I ain't seen or heard nothin'!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I should use that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't you say you heard something strange during the auction? If it stuck out to you so much, it must not have been a sound that you would normally hear. For example... the screams of a murder victim.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ack...! H-How do you keep figurin' everything out so quick? Th-That's right. I stumbled upon a murder in the middle of my stakeout... But please, don't make me say anymore. This is the biggest scoop I've had in a while...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The murder that she overheard... It's most likely the same incident we are currently investigating. This is bound to be crucial information. I'll finish this by confirming the credibility of her information. She has nowhere left to run. It's time to deal the final blow!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tell me what you know about the murder incident... in full detail!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, my memory ain't what it used to be. Not much I can talk about. I ain't the most attentive gal in the world, ya see...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I should use that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd hardly expect a "bona fide journalist" to be so inattentive. Didn't you just say your motto is to be faster and more accurate than anyone?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Uuugh. W-Well, that's...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I expected, the credibility of your information is suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">B-But I know what I heard. ...I even got proof...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have proof? How is that possible...? Explain yourself at once!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I got me some evide... Wait, you heard that!? W-Well... I was just talkin' to myself, y'all just go on and pay it no mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems she's still hiding something. This is an important clue. I'll need to use it effectively.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tell me the truth! I know you're still hiding something from me!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I ain't hidin' nothin' from nobody! I already done told ya everything I know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you really stumble upon a murder?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ya callin' me a liar? ...Them's fightin' words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I'm a bona fide journalist. I would never publish lies in my articles. Faster and more accurate than anyone. That's my motto.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Her motto, huh... This could be a useful clue. I should keep it in mind.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I should use that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">If ya ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't sayin' nothin' neither!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation. I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't there something you haven't told me yet? You have evidence regarding the incident you witnessed! Something definitive enough to publish in an article!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">A-A-Aaaaaaaaaghh! Wh-What in tarnation...? Let me off the hook already... Fine! I'll tell ya everythin'! I'll even show ya the photo I took if ya stop harassin' me! That good enough for ya?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Checkmate.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I lost... I really lost... The Mouth of South... has been defeated.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, it's time to come clean. Tell me everything that you know.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">...I was watchin' the auction... Gatherin' info for my story.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">You didn't just watch, though. You got shocking photos too! Right?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Uugh... A little while after the auction started... ...someone won a bid, and the Conductor banged the gavel. Someone hollered, "We'll finish the deal upstairs", or somethin' like that. "That ain't good!" I thought to myself, as I hurried back to hide behind the statue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you see whoever came up?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Not quite, but I reckon the feller that came up was the winner of the bid. I could smell the buttery aroma of big, fat wads of cash.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Buttery aroma...? I can't imagine that at all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I reckon this room is where the bidders ponied up the dough for their purchases. The two of 'em talked for a while...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wait. There was a second person in the storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">You betcha. I reckon it was the Conductor. And then outta nowhere, one of them started screamin'!Almost scared my britches off. I rolled myself up into a ball and kept on layin' bow.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you witnessed the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, I wouldn't say that I witnessed it, but I definitely heard it though.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Didn't you try to stop them?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Just stop right there. That ain't even funny. What's a dainty little thing like me gonna do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Dainty?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">After that, I heard me some rustlin' and bustlin'. The whole time, I was really regrettin' comin' here somethin' fierce.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Well, yeah, that makes sense. I mean...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">But nothin' gets in the way of Lotta Hart and her photos!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">........</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">This was my big scoop! Ain't no way I was gonna let it slip away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">A bit later, I hear this loud thud. I figured, it was my last chance to snap a photo from behind the statue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......Well then, would you please show us the photo?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Awww... Why do I have to...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">The person in the red raincoat who attacked Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The person in the red raincoat assaulted the victim in the storeroom... ...and then attacked Kay on the roof?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's only one person in this photo. Where is the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yeah. I thought it was strange too. I coulda sworn there were two of 'em, but... ...when I looked, there was only the one. But, that's gotta be the killer, don't ya reckon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, she's saying the victim disappeared (Victim disappeared - The murder may have occurred in the storeroom during the auction.</thought>...?) You were able to tell this person was the culprit just by looking?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Their hand was stained bright red, so I figured it was them.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">What happened to the auction after the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Nothin' really. It just went on like normal. I guess those rich folks didn't give a hoot. They got some nerve.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The nerve of a journalist is nothing to scoff at either.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ask me anything you want!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Auctioning off evidence is unforgivable!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. How could this be happening under the P.I.C.'s...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I mean, I wanna peek at the evidence too! Poke and prod it, spray luminol all over it. Doing it in secret is unforgivable!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For the most part, I agree. ...That one part, not so much.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">When we find the culprit, I'll punish him scientifically!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Please keep it within the limits of the law.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y'all got somethin' to say?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Not too shabby, wouldn't you say? I'm pretty happy with how it turned out myself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After you heard the voices, there wasn't anyone else here besides this person in the photo?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I'm sure if there were, I woulda snapped their picture as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>As "sure" as she may be, I'm not sure if I can rely much on what she says.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">The victim vanishin' out of the blue... Now that would generate some good buzz!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes? Can I help with something?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The person who pushed me! I'm sure it was this person!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yet you don't remember their face.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But... that red raincoat... Umm, I'm sure of it, I think... ........Probably.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please be more clear! I'd like a straight answer.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... When you look at me like that, I begin to lose my confidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">My expression is not relevant. Was it this person, or not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That red raincoat... It has to be the one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If that is true, it would be impossible for Kay to be the culprit. I'll need to gather more evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we assume that the murder took place in this storeroom... ...then we must conclude that the body was here as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Huh? Isn't that... pretty obvious?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you remember how the participants left the auction?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Of course. They'd pass through this storeroom on the way back from the auction... Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. The culprit had to hide the body, so that the participants wouldn't discover it. <thought>The real question is... where was the body hidden? (Where was the body hidden? - Culprit hid the body so it would not be seen by the auction participants.</thought>) Ema, would you mind lending me a hand?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Leave it to me! What do you want me to do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's see... Use your luminol reagent to test for a blood reaction... If you would, please?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">OK! Let me show you the power of science!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The glint in her eyes is getting brighter by the second...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Let's start by examining that ladder over there! Based on Ms. Hart's picture... ...the person in the red raincoat headed towards that ladder. Chances are, something will turn up if we check there! Just touch anything you want to examine! If you do that, you'll be able to spray the luminol reagent at it! If there's a bloodstain on the spot where you sprayed, you'll get a reaction like this. Even so... Ugh. No matter how many times I see bloodstains, they're always so gruesome... There's a blood reaction here, but it's kind of faint. Let's spray it with luminol two or three more times, so it'll be nice and clear! You can see it clearly now. Ugh... It looks even more gruesome than before. Do you understand how to look for bloodstains now? There are probably a few more bloodstains here, so why don't you give it a try, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Let's search the rest of the storeroom for bloodstains just like that! First, let's look for a place to spray the luminol reagent.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Please examine the places you want to spray luminol on!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth! You already examined that bloodstain some time ago. Come on! Let's go look for new bloodstains!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why is she so enthusiastic about this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">You want to examine this spot? Let's spray luminol on every suspicious-looking nook and cranny!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth! There's a bloodstain here too...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However... Why is there a bloodstain in a place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Maybe something that had blood on it was stored inside? <thought>Bloodstain in costume trunk - A bloodstain was found inside the costume trunk at the storeroom.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth, there are places we still haven't checked yet! So, let's continue our investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Do you understand? Criminals always leave behind bloodstains in unexpected places. There could be blood on the windows of your apartment. Or bloodstains on the carpet.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That sounds like a smooth criminal...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Hey! You can't spray luminol on people!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... Of course. I knew that.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">You want to examine this spot? Let's spray luminol on every suspicious-looking nook and cranny!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth! There's a reaction! It's a bloodstain! But... Why in a place like this...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps this was where the murder took place...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ah! It looks like some of the blood dripped down to the floor below.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth, there are places we still haven't checked yet! So, let's continue our investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Is this... the victim's blood?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">You want to examine this spot?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Unfortunately, there were no reactions here...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Looks like we've found all the bloodstains in this storeroom!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems we have investigated the storeroom sufficiently.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The reason why we found a bloodstain in the costume trunk... ...is because the murderer hid the body in that box!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I wonder who won the bid for it. The trunk, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That, I don't know... <thought>In a certain way, everything worked out exactly as someone wanted.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn> <cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn> It couldn't have been in that dressin' box!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">When I first came down here, that box caught my eye too. It was just the right side and woulda made the perfect hidin' place! That's what I thought, anyway... But I couldn't get the dang thing to open. It'd been wrapped up real tight with a locked chain. The murder happened after that, so hidin' a body in there woulda been impossible, ya know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A chain wrapped around it? That's a bit strange... Right now, it doesn't seem to be locked up at all...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">...Huh? That's weird. Maybe my eyes were playin' tricks on me or somethin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ask me anything you want!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">What a splendid bloodstain.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think there is anything splendid about bloodstains.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Of course there is! You see, even bloodstains have various...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............</line>
<line speaker="Ema">...Scientifically speaking! Wait, are you even listening, Mr. Edgeworth!? In fact, it may be called a luminol test, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By the way, Ema, I would like to return to the investigation soon.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Whaaaat!? But I'm not even halfway through my explanation yet!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y'all got somethin' to say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you not notice this bloodstain?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Oh, did ya find that with the lumina-whatsit?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. ...It's likely that the culprit tried to cover up the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I ain't even noticed that at all. Did that happen when I wasn't lookin'? Because, ya know, I didn't actually see the moment of the murder myself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... You were cowering in fear at the time, were you not?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I'm a journalist, ya hear! I was hunkerin' down to protect my scoop! ...I reckon I was snug as a bug behind the Alif Red statue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is precisely what I mean by "cowering in fear."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And with that, I believe we have examined everything there is to examine here.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Well then, let's head on down!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh, have we decided on our next destination? Heeeey, Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Yes, Mr. Shields!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We wouldn't want you to get lost, so make sure you stay real close to Uncle Ray, kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! I'll follow you closely, Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These two... Since when did they get along like that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha-wha-wha-wha...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This place is...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Is this the auction hall?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No, it's... the meeting room from before!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ha... Ha ha ha... Wah hah hah hah hah! How nice of you to drop in, Kay Faraday!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">You've got some guts! Hey, you guys, arrest her! Arrest her!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wait, Kay is...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">As for the rest of the riff-raff, just show them out the door!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">This is tyranny!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah! It's tyranny, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miiiles. This is kinda bad.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">The light of justice shines above me! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hayaaaaargh! YEEEEEEOOWCH!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-Why... me too...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh, that's strange. I was aiming for that weak ex-prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">You were clearly aiming at me!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Maybe something got in my way. Particularly...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">HNGYEEEAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...right around here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Just what do you think you're doing here, Ex-prosecutor Miles Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I do not believe that Kay is the culprit behind this incident.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You're just an ordinary man without investigation rights. What you say does not matter... I am Franziska von Karma. I will never stop moving forward. However, you chose to quit. The outcome of our battle has already been decided.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I cast away my badge... because it became a millstone around my neck. I shall continue moving forward, even without it. The path I walk will surely lead to the truth... My actions are driven by that belief. And that is something which will never change.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">So, you're saying that you've found a path to the truth? Then show it to me! But if that path... proves to be a foolish one, it will not survive my whip!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The victim used her keycard and entered this room with the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ms. von Karma seems really confident, doesn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, I see! She's a fiery one, isn't she? I don't mind a feisty cutie. So how about an introductory hu-UUUUUG!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...How repulsive. Well, Miles Edgeworth. Can you break my logic? If you truly have no intention of stopping here, prove it to me with evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Very well. I'll show you, Franziska. The evidence that paves my path!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The victim used her keycard and entered this room with the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was there nothing suspicious about the security system?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The meeting room's security is perfect, much like my logic. ...There is no room for doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Your logic isn't as perfect as you think...</thought> ...In any case, your opinion has not changed?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes. The victim and the culprit entered the room together.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Then, the culprit stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra, killing her.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did the victim's wounds match up with the candelabra?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The victim's chest was pierced in three places simultaneously by a sharp metal object. Is there anything else that could have done such a thing? That should all be written in Dr. Young's autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So you're sure that the murder weapon was the candelabra?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Exactly. As for who the culprit is...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Shouldn't the letter make it obvious who the culprit is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have anything to confirm that the letter was actually sent by Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Are you proposing that it was forged by the real criminal? That possibility was dismissed some time ago. There were no traces of forgery on the letter. Of course, there were no other traces besides Kay Faraday and the victim found on the letter.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Are you saying you found Kay's fingerprints on the letter?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The only fingerprints we found belonged to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">In other words... you can't really say that Kay is the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Didn't I just say that the possibility of a forgery has been dismissed? That letter was originally sent by Kay Faraday. Therefore, it is only natural to assume that she is the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Of course, the crime scene was right here in this room: the P.I.C. meeting room.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have any proof that the crime took place in this room?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">"A Von Karma is perfect in every way." Perhaps you forgot that when you gave up your badge?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The proof is the bloodstain we found here in the meeting room! That settles it, Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Have we determined who the blood actually belongs to?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The blood analysis confirmed that it belonged to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just because the bloodstain was found here, doesn't mean that this was the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You forget, Miles Edgeworth, that in court, evidence is everything. If you believe this room is not the crime scene, show me the evidence that proves it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Evidence that shows where the crime took place? We may not be in court, but... I'll show her the truth!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ms. von Karma isn't showing any openings!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, there is one fact we know that she does not.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">They're not the only ones who can perform scientific investigations!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And therein lies the proof... the path to the truth I've found!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If memory serves me correctly... ...the blood in the meeting room was found in front of the statue of Lady Justice, was it not?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">To murder someone before Lady Justice... This culprit knows no fear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder about that. Have a look at this piece of evidence. Blood was found in the storeroom right above the meeting room. As you can see, there are signs that it has dripped down onto the floor below. And right under the hidden lift is...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The statue of Lady Justice...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then you understand. The murder did not take place here. The killer murdered the victim in the storeroom, and then moved the body to this room. What Lady Justice witnessed was a coward trying to conceal their crime! And not the moment of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...She's smiling?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Pardon me. I just remembered a conversation quite similar to this one. As I expected, Miles Edgeworth. ...Such naïveté couldn't possibly be an act.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Just how is Mr. Edgeworth naïve!? YEOOOOOOWCH!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Have you forgotten? Or are you just playing the foolish fool? The amount of blood in the meeting room is clearly greater than in the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Uugh... Please don't just hit me and then ignore me... YEAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Such a large amount of blood couldn't have simply dripped from the floor above. And even if it had, there should have been much more blood left behind in the storeroom! The murder could not have occurred anywhere other than this meeting room!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph. You're as predictable as always, Franziska.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wh-What...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The difference in the amount of blood is just as you say. The question is, why does such a difference exist?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That issue is trivial. I've already explained it with my perfect logic.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, how do you explain the blood that was found in the storeroom? I don't suppose you're going to tell me that it somehow sprayed all the way up there?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Like a water fountain? No waaay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. It's impossible. In other words... ...the reason for the difference in the amount of blood is... <thought>The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was stabbed with the murder weapon in the meeting room!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth, who was it that said the storeroom was the scene of the crime? Take responsibility for your own claims!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwaaah! <thought>It seems I was mistaken! The blood in the storeroom must have been left when the victim was stabbed. There must have been another moment when the victim was bleeding more heavily. That would explain why such a large amount of blood was left in the meeting room!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It seems you can't explain the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Do not take me lightly. I already know the answer to that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was stabbed in the storeroom with the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Being stabbed in the storeroom doesn't explain the difference in the amount of blood... That explanation is unacceptable!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmmph! <thought>So it wasn't that! The blood in the storeroom must have been left when the victim was stabbed. There must have been another moment when the victim was bleeding more heavily. That would explain why such a large amount of blood was left in the meeting room!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It seems you can't explain the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Do not take me lightly. I already know the answer to that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim died of a stab wound. Naturally, there would be a significant amount of blood loss.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...That's obvious just from looking at the bloodstain.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But that's so weird! She was attacked in the storeroom, but there was less blood found there than... GYAAAUUGH!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Silence! You third-rate prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But I'm the Best... GYAAAUUGH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you know when you lose the most blood after getting stabbed with a sharp object?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Ah! I know! It's when the sharp object is pulled out, right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. After being stabbed with the candelabra, the body was moved to the meeting room. And then, the murder weapon was pulled out right here in this very room... That would account for the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">But why would the culprit go through all that trouble?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Most likely to give the impression that the murder occurred in the meeting room. It seems Ms. Crane's keycard was used last night... ...but based on the time of use, it must have been a ploy by the culprit to mislead us. In all likelihood, it was the culprit who used the keycard to enter the meeting room.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Why would culprit have needed to do that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps they feared that the storeroom would be found out during the investigation? If they were involved in the auction, they would not have wanted it to become public.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The auction... you say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps you should go upstairs and see for yourself what items are on display. I'm sure that will allow you to understand what occurred here.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">........ ...Impressive, Miles Edgeworth. You're willing to go that far to protect her?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's something big lurking behind the scenes of this case. Kay simply got caught up in it.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You're exaggerating.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Am I now? More than anyone, I would think you'd understand the significance behind all this. Why would you, a prosecutor working with Interpol, be involved in a domestic case? Wasn't your objective to crush a certain international smuggling ring? If your search for smuggled goods has led you here... ...then, isn't this feeling I have related to the case?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...I'm relieved. You haven't lost your touch, even though you've turned in your badge. I've heard about your situation... from Scruffy over there.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah, umm... sorry, sir. I just wanted to help out somehow...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A wise decision, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, are you the one in charge of this case? Isn't Interpol pursing the black market auction?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And what if I am? That's not something you need to know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you knew about all this from the very beginning? You knew the black market auction was being held... right here.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey, hey, mind if I butt in? About that gal who turned up dead...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey! I ain't done talkin' yet! AIIIEEEE! Ya ain't changed a lick!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This case doesn't need even a fragment of your faulty testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya sayin'!? I'm a bona fide journa-OWWW!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Back then...! You gave false testimony...!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">...Ms. von Karma seems to really dislike Lotta.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I can't say she's fond of her.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ain't that Crane gal one of them P.I.C. members? She's the spittin' image of the Conductor! I reckon she's... YEEOOOWCH! She hit me! She hit me again!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What is the meaning of this!? Answer me, Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From Ms. Hart's testimony, we obtained a description of what the Conductor was wearing. And it matches what the victim, Jill Crane, was wearing.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You mean to say... the one who was murdered was the Conductor! ........!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">M-Ms. von Karma, maybe you should calm... AIIEEEEE!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It would seem that a new fact has just been brought to light. ...Indeed, I came here in pursuit of the black market auction. In order to arrest the organizer of the event... in other words, the Conductor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we believe Ms. Hart's testimony, then the Conductor is already dead. Wouldn't this mean that your investigation has ended in vain?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's right. However... ...I swear on my name that I will not return empty-handed! I challenge you, Miles Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A challenge is fine, but... ...why is she readying her whip like she's out for a victim of her own?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I will concede your argument. The murder occurred in the storeroom, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...That is all. I trust you have no objections.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, that is not the case, because there is a hole in your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I didn't noticed anything at all! Well then, please settle this with one blow!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, of course. Watch as I crush her logic!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I will concede your argument. The murder occurred in the storeroom, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were surprisingly quick to concede.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I simply cannot deny facts that are backed by evidence. ...That is all. You have proven that the murder occurred in the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That would mean the culprit is someone who participated in the auction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The culprit participated in the auction... I'd like to hear your basis for this claim.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">When I spoke with the staff of this building, not a single one mentioned the storeroom. The storeroom's existence must have only been known to a select few.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that's where the items for the auction were being stored...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I see you understand. Yes, the culprit participated in the auction.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If that photographer is correct, the victim was the Conductor, and the culprit was a customer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're saying that the victim was the auction's Conductor?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Right, and the culprit...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey, ain't ya the one who told her that just a moment ago!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That's right; however, I was simply making sure her logic is clear...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That ain't right... Yer doin' it wrong. This is the part where yer supposed to say "I dun goofed."</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The culprit was a customer participating in the black market auction.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What in tarnation!? Now you've done it! Don't cover for him!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Of course... that is only if this photographer's testimony is need true.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't tell whether they're on good or bad terms...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The issue here is the culprit's actions.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The culprit waited for the victim in the storeroom, where the goods were delivered.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hart was in the storeroom at the time. Could the culprit really have been waiting there?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I don't know where she was hiding, but... ...since you've seen it, you must know as well. There are numerous hiding places in that storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the culprit was hiding while they waited for the victim to arrive...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended. After all, the victim was the organizer of the auction, the Conductor. During the auction, the organizer would have to be in front of the customers the entire time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>After the auction ended...?</thought> Please add that statement to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Adds statement">"I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended."</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was killed after the auction ended... Are you certain of that?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The victim was the Conductor. That is the only possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Without the Conductor, the auction couldn't have been held.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The auction couldn't have been held...? <thought>Something seems odd in this testimony...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Then, they stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra in the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The candelabra in the storeroom? How do you know that?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If the murder weapon had been prepared in advance... ...the victim's chest would have been stabbed with something completely different. Based on the culprit's auctions, it's clear where the murder weapon came from.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">There were signs suggesting that the candelabra was once placed in the storeroom, too.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The items in the storeroom were intended to be sold as goods in the auction. Although, where the murder weapon was procured from is not the main issue here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>At first glance, her logic seems to hold up, but something just doesn't feel quite right... I'll need to draw out more information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I thought, you are one step behind.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What did you say...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was not the Conductor, and I have proof. Ms. Hart's testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That photographer's testimony is not truthworthy!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya'll sayin'!? I'm a bona fide journa- OWWW!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Cease your idle chatter!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">YEEEHAAAWW!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, calm down and listen. Ms. Hart witnessed a part of the murder. The main point here is that after witnessing the murder, she says the auction continued...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's right! Sure as can be! They all just kept goin' on shamelessly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you think the auction could have continued without someone conducting it? If the victim was not the Conductor, the person killed must have been... a customer!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Nooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I said from the beginning, Kay is not the culprit. After all, she herself was attacked by someone and lost consciousness. In which case, that would also make her a victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">If the auction continued after the incident occurred...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And the victim was not the Conductor, but a customer...</line>
<line speaker="???">That's enough!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That voice...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Order in the court. The Chairman will now enter.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. No need to be so stiff. Actually... feel free to call me Blaisie.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Well, then... Blaisie, what brings you here?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? Well, well. I just wanted to see if my idiot son was working hard, is all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this kind of father-son relationship really healthy...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I had come to light a fire under you, but it seems I've found an unexpected bonus. To think that the criminal who has become the talk of the town would be here, of all places.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Everyone! Restrain the suspect at once.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please wait! Kay Faraday is not the cul-</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">This is quite troubling, Edgeworth. Didn't I tell you earlier? The P.I.C. desires a swift resolution to this case. If it's not, we could lose our trust with the public. They'd call us the Waste of Time Committee. Y'know, it's troubling for me as well, that sort of thing... And at my age too... *sniff* *sniff*</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And on top of that... an illegal investigation is not something that I can overlook. Have you forgotten? You are no longer a prosecutor. You have lost all your authority. Furthermore... you have aided a criminal in evading the law.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. That's right. You're so reliable, Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am aware of the consequences of my actions. You may punish me as you wish. However... ...we have found a new suspect. It's the person pictured here. Kay Faraday was attacked by this person and...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There is no need for your explanation. Just recently, a red raincoat was discovered in the vicinity of this building. The victim's blood and cherry blossom petals were found on the hood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Cherry blossom petals? <thought>Now that you mention it, on the viewing platform...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. They probably stuck on due to the blood. They were littered around the bloodstain.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">And we've received the forensic report on the blood, y'know. There's no doubt about it. The person in that photo is the victim, Jill Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What did you saaaaaaay!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-Impossible! That would completely destroy the foundations of our logic. We had believed the person in the red raincoat was the culprit. And now it turns out... that person is actually the murder victim. W-Wait. If that's the case, then the prime suspect would be...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Faraday. You met a person in a red raincoat on the rooftop, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes. I did, but...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The person in the red raincoat was the murder victim. And Kay Faraday came into contact with that person. Since one of the parties is now dead, what happened next should be clear...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay was attacked by that person! As the victim, it would be impossible for her to be the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There is no evidence she was attacked, is there? Furthermore, we must consider the possibility that the victim fought back.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's far too early to come to that conclusion! Kay is not the criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">......You're wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">K-Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's... wrong. Even though I don't want to believe it myself... After hearing about the raincoat, I finally remembered. I only remember a little, but... from what I saw that night... ...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That can't be right!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, why? Why do I have that memory? That person collapsed before my eyes... engulfed in a pool of blood... Why didn't I do anything? It must have been... because I killed her...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It is clear to me, the validity of Kay Faraday's memory.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Didn't you doubt it until just now, pal!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Congratulations, Ms. Faraday. Your courage will surely allow you to be forgiven. Now, let us rejoice in the blessings of the Goddess of Law!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Allow me to give my opinion as an international prosecutor! Her actions as a criminal are...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hurry! Arrest Kay Faraday at once!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">How dare you behave that way before me...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're being too forceful! Further verification is necessary! I'd even go so far to say this is unlawful!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Unfortunately, the law does not side with you.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It sides with me, y'see. But y'know, the beautiful bond between you two has been etched deeply into my heart.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That reminds me... we seem to have forgotten one additional suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth. That's you.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's that, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth hasn't done anything wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I beg to differ! ...That's right. Y'see... He's no longer a prosecutor, sadly enough.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Your actions have gone too far this time. An illegal investigation, and assisting in the escape of a criminal... I cannot even think of you as a former prosecutor! Now, humbly accept your punishment!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Oh, yes, that's right. I believe the plan of today was to hold your hearing before the P.I.C. Why don't we leave the hearing for tomorrow. Even though the result is already crystal clear. You should think long and hard about what you've done. ...Very long and very hard.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Court is now adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is the second time I've been in this cell... ...All of my evidence has been taken from me. The only thing I have left is Kay's Yatagarasu's badge. I'm worried about Kay... Is she alright?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Guard">You have a visitor. Please hurry out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A visitor? Who could it be...?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Someone by the name of Dick Gumshoe. Will you turn him down?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No. <thought>It will be hard to face him, though.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Guard">Wait there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm. He's not going to stay and keep watch...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Pardon me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hush. Please, have a seat.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are you here? I was told the detective had come.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If I didn't instruct them to tell you that, you wouldn't be sitting here right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't think of anything she'd need from me at this point. I should try to figure out what she wants...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Your visitation rights have been restricted to begin with.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's as if I'm some monstrous criminal... I suppose my credibility has hit rock bottom.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">But of course. Your friends have fared a little better though. That lawyer and that girl were both quite worked up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mr. Shields and Ema...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When I last saw them, they were giving one of the guards quite an earful.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? You don't mean...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Be grateful. The Goddess of Law has been quite busy. They were spared punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It certainly seems like you have plenty of time for small talk.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Oh, yes. Prosecutor von Karma is presently continuing the investigation. You were worried about them, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I guess she saw right through me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If it's about Kay Faraday, I believe she's being interrogated as we speak.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You people... Do you have any idea what you're doing? How dare you arrest an innocent person!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's not a very nice thing to say... I would ask that you correct your statement. She is merely someone you want to believe is innocent. ...Am I wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is no decisive evidence to prove that she's the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There is no evidence to prove her innocence either... Enough of this. It's pointless.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The girl will be judged. There is nothing you can do to stop that. That's all there is to say about that. Now, let's get to the real issue at hand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's cut to the chase. Exactly what are you planning?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am not planning anything. There is merely a question I wish to ask.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You're asking me?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, of course. Who else is here? Objectively speaking... you are a clever individual, and you have a sharp mind. As a prosecutor, you are highly talented and capable.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you being ironic? Your sarcasm falls short.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am being completely sincere. And that is why I cannot understand. Take this case, for example. You're up against the P.I.C. There is no chance for you to come out on top. Even a child could understand. And yet, you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Perhaps my younger self would not have done something so reckless. ...The me from before had power. That's why I thought justice was on my side. Just like you right now...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, because of a certain man, my self-centered sense of justice was broken down. Ever since then... I began to see people in a different sight. I'm able to serve as a prosecutor only because of the support of the people around me. People like Detective Gumshoe, and all the other investigators. And... Kay, as well. Honestly, even I'm surprised at how much I have changed...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see... Is that how it is? I've come to understand you a little more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Understand me? Not likely. Someone like you, who forces her own sense of justice onto others could never understand.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I wonder about that. Is that what you think?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If I could say one thing... ...it would be that this conversation has been very interesting. ...That is all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Our conversation is coming to an end, however... I have one last thing to tell you. The date of your hearing has been set. I came here today to inform you. Today. In the P.I.C. meeting room. May you humbly accept your fate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...If that's all you wanted to say, couldn't you have just sent a messenger?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The holy words of the Goddess of Law simply cannot be entrusted to others. With that, Mr. Edgeworth, I bid you farewell. I shall be seeing you again later.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a poster hanging in the hallway. "The Dice N' Silce Game! Roll the dice and decide your daily menu... The Dice N' Silce Game has been cancelled due to the warden's arrest. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to it." <thought>There's no need to apologize for canceling such a silly game!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I mustn't neglect my personal appearance just because I'm in a holding cell. Prosecutor or not, this is my personal duty...</thought> Hm? My collar is slightly bent! ........There. A well-groomed appearance reflects a well-groomed mind. <thought>From here on, I'll need to focus myself more than ever!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There's a dining menu sitting on the desk. It seems I can get food delivered if I pay for it.</thought> ...Let's see. Moldy white bread lunch set. Switch to moldy whole-wheat bread for an extra dollar. Oatmeal and grits set meal. For a limited time, get extra gruel at no additional cost. <thought>Thank goodness I'm not hungry right now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There's a poster on the wall next to the toilet.</thought> "We are currently out of toilet paper. Please be prepared if you wish to use the toilet." <thought>What does it mean by "be prepared"...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a simple bed. I don't expect it to be very comfortable to sleep on. <thought>If it were Detective Gumshoe, he would probably snore loudly while sleeping like a dog. I may never get a chance to work with him again... However, this is the path I chose! I won't regret it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are thick bars placed securely on the window. <thought>That reminds me, I watched a movie that had iron bars just like these. It was about a plan to escape a prison by filing down the iron bars. Of course, I wouldn't do such a thing. I don't even have a file.</thought> ...No. Even if I had one, I still wouldn't do it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Another visitor...?</thought> Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems you're alright. I'm relieved... for now.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, this is kinda touching... *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You look a little down, Kay... Please, cheer up. You didn't do anything wrong. I guarantee it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Please, just accept it. I am a murderer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not true! Why won't you believe in yourself!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What should I believe in? I mean... there's nothing...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing to believe in? That's not true. Before you lost your memories, you literally jumped into my life. As a result, your words and actions have become engraved in my memories... That's the mark you left behind. How can you call that "nothing"? I believe in your innocence. That's why you must believe in yourself as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.....Thank you. But, it's no use. Look at all the misfortune I've brought upon you. If you can, please forget it all. Your memories of Kay Faraday...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, this takes me back. In my youth, I too was a gallant...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is this... the kind of justice that the P.I.C. seeks?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hmm... Justice, huh? I wonder...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This man, what is he planning? Why is he pushing things forward so forcefully...? It all seems too unnatural. Is there a hidden agenda? There's no time left! It's all or nothing now!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well then, I must take my leave...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No matter how you look at it, Kay's arrest was unnatural... There must be something behind it.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hey, hey. I'm a busy man, y'know. I'm kind of a big deal, y'see. I trust this won't take up too much of my time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In order to make it out of this situation, I must break through his defenses!</thought> There are plenty of things I want to ask, but my time is limited.  First, I'll ask about why he rushed the arrest. I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay is not the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. That's a rather bold claim, y'know? Anyone can shout objections at the top of their lungs, y'see. Mr. Former Prodigy Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh...! It's no use... I don't have enough information! My chance will come, sooner or later...! And when it does, I mustn't let it slip by.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did you rush her arrest!? I would like a clear explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Explanation? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't play dumb with me! You clearly did not follow the proper procedures!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">OK, OK. Maybe you should pipe down a bit. Do you even know the position you're in?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Suppose we let the criminal escape. What do you think will happen?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What will happen?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I would be made to take responsibility, y'see. I do hope you understand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Just take my advice and stay out of this, if you know what's good for you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....I refuse. Kay is innocent!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know... This is so pitiful... It brings me to tears. Why won't you just give up...? Things were finally going well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Things were going well, you say? That's a strange way to put it. It almost sounds as if you personally wanted Kay to be arrested... ...far more than necessary. Haven't you lost your impartiality?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hmm, you think so? That certainly wasn't my intention, y'see... Edgeworth, my boy, you're reading too much into it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He skillfully avoided the issue... However, I still have some serious doubts about Kay's arrest. Next, I shall ask him if the investigation was sufficient. I can't miss even the tiniest piece of information. That's the only way to break through this situation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How much time was spent on the investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, I wonder about that...? I don't really remember, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is no way I can accept such a careless answer!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Like I said, I don't remember. My memory's not as sharp as it used to be, y'see. Sometimes I even forgot my own son's name.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't care about your idiot son! I want your answer regarding the investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y-Yes, he really is an idiot... Even though I don't remember raising him like that. *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no end to this... He just keeps on dodging the question. Let's try another line of attack to make him take me seriously.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's hard to say that the investigation was sufficient! The arrest... Was it under your authority!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. Do I really look that important?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee Chairman... It's quite a prominent title. Not that I care much for it.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Th-That was rather blunt. I'm so shocked, I could cry...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry... Flattery was never my forte.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I-If you keep talking me like that t-towards me... ...y-you'll never get your prosecutor's badge back, y'know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me make this clear right now. I do not live for the sake of my badge! Status means nothing to me. Do you understand?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...... Young... So young... Let me teach you something as your senior in life. What you're saying right now... It's far too naïve, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The look in his eyes has changed! He might respond differently to some of my questions now. This is my chance!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay is not the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. That's a rather bold claim, y'know? Anyone can shout objections at the top of their lungs, y'see. Mr. Former Prodigy Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh...! It's no use... I don't have enough information! My chance will come, sooner or later...! And when it does, I mustn't let it slip by.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hrmmm. Well, well. Aren't you an impertinent one? Even someone like me... is starting to get annoyed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What a coincidence. I feel the same way. Answer me! Was the investigation sufficient?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Young folks always live life in the fast lane... That's why I like to bully 'em. You'll regret this, soon enough.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>

<line speaker="Blaise">Hmm? You sure are quiet. Are you scared? Ah ha ha.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Ridiculous... I was just thinking about my next strategy... ...on how to extract information from a weepy old man.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You should show some remorse, y'know. Don't you get it? I hold your fate in my hands.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">In any case... even if you obtained some information... ...there's nothing you can do. Just give up already.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I refuse.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Mind if I ask why?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's simple. The truth is fading away... That's all there is to it!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I see. I'm starting to understand what kind of person you are. But y'know, it's all useless. It's enough to make me cry. G-Give it up. That girl's guilt has already been d-decided.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's strange... The way you said that, it almost sounds like it was decided from the very beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... it's clearly unnatural. Everything is progressing as if Kay's guilt was predetermined. Wasn't Kay's arrest... planned from the start?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....I see. That's an interesting theory. But I don't have time to indulge in your flights in fancy, y'know. Why don't we put an end... to this silly conversation?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C-Curses! He's trying to get away! Before that, I must find out if the arrest was lawful! It's still very faint, but... I'm beginning to see the path to the truth. I can't let this opportunity slip by!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay is not the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. That's a rather bold claim, y'know? Anyone can shout objections at the top of their lungs, y'see. Mr. Former Prodigy Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh...! It's no use... I don't have enough information! My chance will come, sooner or later...! And when it does, I mustn't let it slip by.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please wait! There is still something I want to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I-I've grown weary of our little tête-à-tête... Please keep it short, okay?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who was the one who made the decision to arrest her?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hrmm. Well... I can't say I remember. Growing old is a terrible thing, y'see. My memory's not what it used to be, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If I put together what you have told me up until now... ...I cannot help but say that there is no basis for Kay's arrest.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. I understand, I understand, y'see. But y'know, it doesn't really matter either way. You can't overturn her arrest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How irresponsible! Do you still claim to be a man of the law?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. Those are some harsh words, y'know? Hrmm... Y'know, you're starting to make me a little angry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'see, to be honest... I really can't answer all of your questions, y'know. That's just the position I'm in, y'see. I'm a busy man, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Aren't you just pretending to be busy?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Th-That's cruel, y'know... This old chunk of coal has been working like a dog. Pretending... Just what do you think that would accomplish?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>

<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You don't want to talk about the case... Isn't that... why you're trying to get away from this place?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">How sad. Yes. How sad indeed... Do you really suspect little old me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do suspect you. And I'm confident about it. There was clearly no basis for Kay's arrest.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. Have you forgotten? Wasn't there evidence? The mask, the letter, and the corsage... All were found in the girl's possession. Not to mention, she even confessed. All of this serves to prove her crime.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Any objections?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'see? You have no response.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's true, I have no objections. <thought>...Although, there is one point that bothers me. This man... seems awfully familiar with the evidence. To remember everything without missing a beat... That intrigues me. This could be a useful clue.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I should use that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't play dumb with me. Didn't you remember all of the evidence in full detail just now!? Stop pretending to be a forgetful old man when things aren't going your way!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then! Who was the one who made the decision to arrest her?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I see. You're a sharp one, aren't you? Y'know, I wish my son could learn from you... ...because he's a real idiot... *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not interested in your son! Who made the decision for the arrest!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y-You're a bad man, y'know... Don't you already know? The one who ordered her arrest...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person right in front of me. I'm certain of it.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ouch. You make it sound like I committed some kind of injustice. Guess I'll have to clear that up. My honor's at stake here, y'see. Very well. I'll continue to play along with you... until you are satisfied.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is most crucial here is... ...how much this man knows about this case. If I can get him to reveal that...! It's do or die! If I can overcome this, I'll reach the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The suspect. Regarding Kay... How much do you know about her?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">She's the suspect in this case. That's all I know, y'see. Scout's Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I should use that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Something you've said feels out of place. You know about things that the crime scene investigation never revealed. Why is that? Just how much of the truth do you know!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....Ah ha ha. You're making that forceful face again. Y'know, it kinda makes me want to do the same. Like this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You really are a persistent one, y'know? But I can admire that, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will take that as a compliment...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Can't you give it a rest already? At my age... my body's not as strong as it once was, y'know... Th-There is no one else who could be the c-culprit, besides her. She was even given that much evidence to show that she committed the crime...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She was given evidence, you say? That's an odd choice of words. It almost sounds... as if she did not possess them under her own will.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....! I see... You really do have a fine eye for the details... As expected of a former prodigy prosecutor. You've already found your answer, haven't you? I'm listening, so go ahead and say it. There's no need to hold back.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I have finally wrenched open... the heavy door to the truth! Now... all that remains is to strike the final blow!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You seem pretty familiar with the case...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I'm a wise man, y'know. I'm familiar with most things, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think it was very wise of you to arrest Kay in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....I'm a very busy man. I can end this conversation any time I want, y'know. Don't you forget about that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This would've already been over if you had simply answered my questions. If you give me a proper answer, I won't take any more of your time. I will ask you once again! Why are you so familiar with this case?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....I read the case files, y'see. Honestly, it was quite a drag, y'know. But it's my job, so what could I do... ...b-because of my position, y'see. I can't just skip out on it. *Sob* *Sob* *Sob* Well, I had some time to kill... So I read the whole thing, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's strange. Didn't you just say you were very busy?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Aren't your faults slowly coming to light now? If you truly wish to protect your position, I would advise you to rescind the arrest order.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y-You really are desperate, y'know? That never-say-die attitude... it touched my heart. But y'know... It's unfortunate that all your hard work was for naught. Because we discovered her unconscious body near the crime scene, y'see...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh... That was a wasted remark.</thought> I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>

<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the first I've heard of Kay's condition when she was found. She was... unconscious in the storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....! That's right... The source of that information is classified, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This man knows things even I don't know. Does he know the whole story behind this case...? This could be a useful clue.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay is not the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. That's a rather bold claim, y'know? Anyone can shout objections at the top of their lungs, y'see. Mr. Former Prodigy Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh...! It's no use... I don't have enough information! My chance will come, sooner or later...! And when it does, I mustn't let it slip by.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I shall break through this with that clue!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay was framed! The true culprit is pinning the blame on her! That is my answer!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">............................ Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yes, yes. You're a clever one. It almost makes me feel bad that your prosecutor's badge was taken away, y'know. Yes. It's as you say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Checkmate...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You arrested Kay, even when you knew of the existence of the true culprit...? Don't toy with me! There is no way such an act would be tolerated!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You sure are green, y'know. That's what a prosecutor is supposed to do. It will all work out fine, if we make her guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who would desire... such a resolution!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">If I had to say, maybe the P.I.C. And also, maybe me, y'know? Ah ha ha ha ha! When I heard your words just now, I could barely hold back my tears, y'know. It was just so splendid, y'see. And it burns me up inside! I'm not the most perfect piece of work, y'know. So I can't forgive such youthfulness. You say the truth is important. But y'know... Once you know the real value of the truth holds, I wonder if you can still say the same thing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">When you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Good, very good. That face. That expression! You were such a desperate one, y'see. That's why I really wanted to bully you, y'know? Y'see, even if you know the truth, there is simply nothing you can do. And that's the real value of truth. So shocking that it's to die for, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why don't you pursue the true culprit!? How much of the truth do you know!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Do you understand now? The truth that you believe in is worthless, y'see. ...Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you? Powerless "former" prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ooh, scary, scary. Y'know, I guess the friends of a heinous criminal are also quite heinous themselves.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise! Yoooouuuuuuu!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">And like this, y'see, one more person will disappear before me. Ahh, here come the waterworks. These tears of mine just won't stop, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Everything will be decided in today's deliberation... Kay's innocence... I will definitely prove it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ten members are present. The quorum has been met... From here on out, let the council begin! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A clear conscience... Don't make me laugh.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Courtney, please give us your report.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">On April 5th, Prosecutor Edgeworth carried out an illegal investigation and resisted arrest. He was arrested by two of our members who caught him in the act: myself and Blaise Debeste. Prosecutor Edgeworth disrupted the investigation of Attorney Jill Crane's murder. He claims that the culprit, Kay Faraday, was arrested without sufficient evidence. Even now, his claim remains unchanged.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Tell us more... about the murder incident.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">On April 5th, the victim's body was found here, in the P.I.C. meeting room. Regarding the details...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I, Sebastian Debeste, the best prosecutor, will enlighten you!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The prosecutor in charge, Sebastian Debeste, will explain the rest of the details.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">The murder happened on the night of April 4th. The victim was one Jill Crane. On the same night, a black market auction was being held in this very meeting room. I guess Ms. Crane was taking part in the auction. Yup.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The murder occurred in the middle of the auction, did it not?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">When Ms. Crane was found, she was dressed like the Conductor of the auction. However, based on the fact that the auction continued after the murder occurred... ...I deduced that Ms. Crane could not have been the Conductor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You weren't the one who made that deduction...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sebastian, please show everyone the basis for the arrest of the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">You got it, Justine. Kay Faraday was unable to bear the weight of her good conscience......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I believe you mean her "guilty" conscience.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Yes. It was her guilty conscience that drove her to confess the crime. According to her confession, on the roof of this building... ...she met a figure in a red raincoat on the viewing platform.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">So Crane was wearing a red raincoat?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, that's correct. The culprit used the Conductor's clothes as a red herring to mislead us... At the time of the murder, Ms. Crane was wearing a red raincoat.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It was I who discovered the raincoat near this building!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He did? I'm sure it was the forensics team who found it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">To be more precise, it was the forensics team under Sebastian's orders who discovered it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought as much!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">According to the blood analysis... ...the person in the red raincoat and Ms. Crane were the same person! The decisive evidence is the culprit's own confession. She testified that she killed her! That's right, the culprit is Kay Faraday! It couldn't have been anyone else but her!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well then, Edgeworth. If you have any objections, let's hear them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....I have no objections.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I see, I see. It seems all the fight's gone out of you after your little overnight stay...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have no objections to your claim that I investigated illegally. I admit to that. However! I object to the claim that Kay is the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I will testify that Sebastian's investigation was fair and just.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ha ha ha ha ha! Of course it was, Justine! Don't you know that I'm the fairest of them all!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth, my boy. Despite how things may seem, I actually kinda like you. If...! And this is just an "if", y'see. If you were to withdraw your objection... ...you might be sitting on this side of the bench tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I'll ask you one more time, Edgeworth. Do you have any objections?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Don't take me for a fool.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'd advise you to watch what you say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This man is the one who should watch what he's saying! I'm talking about the case! Not about a chair! I demand a testimony! By all means, let me hear that! I want to know how the P.I.C. understands this case!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">A testimony from us, eh? Fine then. If that's what it takes to make you happy. Courtney, give him the materials from the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sir? But, that's...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It's the end of the line for him. I'll let him go out in a blaze of glory.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...If you insist, Mr. Chairman.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Why don't we have... Courtney give the testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have no objections.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't worry, Kay. You just watch from over there.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The red raincoat was up for auction...? Is that a fact?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It is quite likely. The red raincoat had been a piece of evidence... ...in the assassination attempt on the President of Zheng Fa, as you well know. Originally, it should have been stored in an appropriate place... But when I asked about it... I learned that it went missing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And it somehow made its way to the black market auction... Certainly, a natural conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">My, my. Well done, Courtney. Your explanation is as clear as ever.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I am much obliged. Prosecutor Edgeworth, will you concede defeat now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Sorry, but I don't plan on it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see... I am relieved.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Relieved? What does she mean? Come to think of it... Her reason for questioning me yesterday remains a mystery. Just what is she thinking?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you're saying that a member of the P.I.C. was involved in illicit dealings?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Regarding that... I... I have no response.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">He's right, y'know. After this hearing is over, we're going to have to clean up our act.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">A splendid decision, Mr. Chairman!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Now, now. It is only natural, y'see. There's no need to flatter me, y'know? But, y'know, that has nothing to do with you at all, Edgeworth. Because by then, you won't even be a prosecutor anymore, y'see? Well, now that this tearful business has been cleared up...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, sir. I will continue.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, the red raincoat was also up for auction?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. It had belonged to Shelly de Killer.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Based on the circumstances, we must consider that it was an item up for auction, y'see?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! That was what he wore when he targeted the president of Zheng Fa...! <thought>There was a mannequin that was positioned unnaturally amongst the auction goods... That may have been where the red raincoat had been on display.</thought> Do you know how the goods were procured?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We're currently investigating it... But, it's none of your concern, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Soon, you will be nothing more than an ordinary individual. And then you will be finished.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems the results of this deliberation have already been decided.</thought> ...Enough about me. Please continue your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Since the raincoat had been up for auction...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would the victim immediately leave her seat?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That had to do with how the auction was conducted. It seems that after the winning bid, the winner was required to pay for the item immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That matches up with Ms. Hart's testimony.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We believe that Ms. Crane paid her bid for the raincoat... ...and then immediately tried to leave the auction.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was a P.I.C. member. Couldn't she have also just left from the meeting room?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If she had done so during the auction... ...then its existence would have been revealed to the public.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Since Ms. Hart knew about it, it seems the cat is already out of the bag...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The customers were required to enter and exit from the hatch. Ms. Crane was simply following protocol... Considering where the murder took place, she must have tried to leave through there.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would Kay do such a thing?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We intend to question her about that later.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Later?" That seems to be your favorite time for interrogations.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If the culprit was aware that the customers were required to exit from the hatch... ...it would have been easy to lie in wait for an ambush. Ms. Crane was attacked when she was leaving the hatch...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Met her end", what do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">She passed away... or to be more precise, she was murdered.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The candelabra was one of the items in the auction. Therefore, Kay should not have been able to get her hands on it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If she was able to lie in wait for the attack, then she must have known about the storeroom. If she sneaked into the storeroom during the auction, she could have obtained it.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Now, if we only had some way to know for sure... Where the candelabra was during the entire auction, y'know? How about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... There is... no such evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">My apologies. We hope to find that evidence soon.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth. It's too bad, y'know? It seems you won't be able to use this line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The victim encountered the culprit on top of the roof and the crime occurred there... According to her reasoning, the murder took place at the viewing platform. But was that really the case? Some piece of evidence must tell the whole story behind it. I should try looking again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, I have found it to be strange for a while now. Why is Ms. Hart here with us?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">She is an eyewitness to this case. Isn't it only natural for her to be in attendance?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Aww... shucks, ha ha... I reckon I'm more of an earwitness than an eyewitness.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Heh. It seems that gaining the trust of others isn't your strong point, Judge Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Perhaps I simply do not wish to be as tactless as you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears you have failed to get the witness to tell you the most vital information. Please look at this photo. This was taken by Ms. Hart.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This photo seems to have been taken in the storeroom. And, what of it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">According to your reasoning, the incident took place on the viewing platform. However, Ms. hart encountered the incident in the storeroom! That's right, it had taken place just before this photo was taken!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">W-Wait...! If that's true, then Justine's reasoning...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly, it does not hold up.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hart, allow me to ask you again. You saw the person in the photo with your own eyes, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I sure did. I seen 'em plain as day with my own two eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what did you think at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I figured I was about to get me a big scoop! ...Ya know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I guess that makes sense.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ahem. That's not what I meant. What did you think of that person?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Huh? Well... I reckoned she'd help me bring home the bacon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Are you mocking me?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Aww shucks, don't make that scary ole' face. It was just a harmless little joke. The person in the red raincoat? I reckoned they were the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I hope you understand now. The crime occurred in the...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, I cannot understand your argument if you do not say it out loud. If you had simply asked, I would have been more than willing to explain.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Explain what?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The sounds Ms. Hart heard may not necessarily be related to the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is impossible! Enough of your excuses!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Was the voice that Ms. Hart heard really that of Ms. Crane?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Such a shady conversation must've had somethin' to do with the case!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What did her voice sound like?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">H-Her voice? Well... it beats me. How was I suppos'd to know!? They were both usin' voice changers.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. The voices Ms. Hart heard had been altered by a device. We must therefore question whether or not they have any bearing on this case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You need not object just because you wish to sigh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, it seems I have greatly overestimated you.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">No, no. Courtney is quite amazing, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You claim that the sounds Ms. Hart heard no bearing on this case? Even if they do not, it doesn't change the fact that the crime took place in the storeroom. At the very least, the crime must have occurred before the victim went up to the rooftop. The reason being... This evidence proves the crime occurred before the victim went up to the viewing platform!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Could you take a look at this area?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. What area are you referring to?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... Around here somewhere?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please be more specific!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>It seems I was wrong. This photo was taken after Ms. Harts heard the sounds in the storeroom. There must be something in the photo that connects the sounds to the case!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">As I thought, you cannot show the connection between the sounds and the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. That is not true.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At first, I thought the person in the red raincoat was the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well... Ms. Hart's testimony certainly made it sound that way...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. It was because she saw that the person's hand... was covered in blood. Anyone who heard her testimony would have arrived at the same conclusion. The person in the red raincoat was the culprit... and the blood on their hand was the victim's. However, if the person in the red raincoat was the victim, then the situation changes completely. Since blood can be seen in this photo, it must have been taken after the crime occurred. It seems we've been under the wrong impression in regards to the victim's condition. This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was the Conductor of the black market auction!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">According to what Ms. Hart said, even after the victim was hit... ...the auction still went on, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That is correct.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So wouldn't it be impossible for the victim to have been the Conductor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>I overlooked that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This photo was taken after Ms. Hart heard the sounds in the storeroom. In that case, the blood on that hand must mean...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There is only one answer. In other words, the victim...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim struck the culprit! That was probably when her hand got covered in blood.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. All the blood we found at the crime scene belonged to the victim. Your reasoning doesn't seem to hold up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>I overlooked that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This photo was taken after Ms. Hart heard the sounds in the storeroom. In that case, the blood on that hand must mean...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There is only one answer. In other words, the victim...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom. Immediately afterward, the victim was seen with blood on her hand. That must mean... ...the victim was still alive even after she was attacked. The blood on her hand must have come from her own wound.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">No way! Are you saying that she died from a hand injury?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, that is not the case. I suspect she just held her hand against the wound. It can't be seen in the photo, but at this moment, she must have already suffered a fatal wound.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hoh, hoh. If that's true, then it changes a lot of things, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems you understand. This refutes the allegations against Kay. Kay encountered the victim after this picture was taken... I believe at that point in time, the victim was already on the verge of death. It's likely Kay just happened to be present when the victim reached the end of her strength.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...That is quite the coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I can only say that she was at the wrong place at the wrong time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, it seems you have forgotten a crucial fact.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah, you mean that, right? He must be pretending that he hasn't noticed it, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you say...? Are you implying that I forgot something?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Courtney. I think it's about time you gave him his last rites.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey, pops! Justine's with me, you know! Don't order her around like that!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know... even though you're my son, you're so embarrassing.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I'm not embarrassing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I'm sorry, but you're both rather embarrassing.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Justine! Give Mr. Edgeworth his... umm...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. I shall give him his last rites.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When the body was found, there were three wounds in Ms. Crane's chest.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Well done, Justine! With this, Mr. Edgeworth will...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will offer a rebuttal, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Why would you do that!? Didn't you hear what Justine just said?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course, I did. And I still plan to object to it.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It's not faaaaaiiiir! You're always opposing me at every turn!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was never my intention to oppose you.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....Huh? R-Really?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's simply not worth my time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I-I see. So that's how it is. Yup, yup. After all, I'm...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's enough, y'know. You're embarrassing your father, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh!? What do you mean, pops!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When the body was found, there were three wounds in Ms. Crane's chest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Three wounds... That sounds rather painful.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Indeed... We must punish the culprit accordingly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-I...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. Do not listen to what she says. Judge Courtney. Please continue your reasoning.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. She had three wounds...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm sure you're well aware what kind of wounds these were, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why don't you ask Sebastian instead?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Of course, Sebastian knows all about it.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh? Me? Yeah! I know everything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...He's obviously lying.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Sebastian, maybe you should sneak a peek at the autopsy report, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ummm..... Let's see here... The fatal wound was caused by the candelabra. Oooh! So that's how it was!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Ahem! The cause of the wound was just as Sebastian said.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, she was stabbed in the heart with the three-pronged candelabra.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the cause of death was a stab wound to the heart... Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, the candelabra pierced right into her heart. Since this was Dr. Young's medical opinion, it must be truth.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">The coroner's medical opinion follows my own opinion. Therefore... it's perfect.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I certainly cannot ignore the autopsy reports, however...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey! Don't ignore my opinion!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>However, if the cause of death was a stab wound to the victim's chest... ...wouldn't it contradict that piece of evidence...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Oooh... He's totally ignoring me! Justine! Say something!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. I will not allow you to ignore my reasoning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Is there any person who could survive such an injury?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At the very least... we cannot be certain that she died instantly.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Even if she still had a little bit of life left, I doubt she would have held on for long.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm, can people survive after being stabbed in the chest?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">In some cases, maybe they can. ...Although, maybe they can't.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh... So in the end, which one is it?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...No such human exists. If you think they do, then first...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please take a close look at the autopsy report. Can you still say the same thing after reading it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">According to the autopsy report, the stab wounds to the left chest caused the fatality.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Correct. The autopsy report itself is the foundation for my reasoning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In other words... I just have to shatter that foundation, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I don't find that amusing at all... I look forward to seeing you try. Nevertheless, please take a close look at the autopsy report before you make a rebuttal. Show me that your reasoning is not just mere conjecture.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We'll be fine, Kay. There's nothing for you to worry about. <thought>Evidence that the victim was alive after the incident... If I can just find that, Kay will be...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Chairman Debeste, do you know what this is?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It seems to be a red raincoat. How about it, Courtney?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The victim... Ms. Crane was wearing this earlier. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Must I repeat my explanation to you all over again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose it just might come to that. Judge Courtney, answer me this. This red raincoat was stained with blood... Do you happen to remember where specifically those bloodstains were located?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Of course I do. They were on the hood... W-Wait, it can't be!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hm? What does this mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, were there any other bloodstains besides the ones on the hood?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">None... were detected.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you think it's strange? The victim died from a stab wound to the chest. In that case, there should have been bloodstains on the front of the raincoat. However... the only blood they found was on the hood! This is a huge contradiction! The wound on the victim's head is no ordinary wound. After all, the victim sustained this wound before she was stabbed in the chest.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...It does appear that way, doesn't it? The victim first suffered the head wound. If she had already been stabbed in the chest, the raincoat would have been stained with blood... Therefore, it is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she stuffed the head wound. So the order of the wounds would be: first the head, followed by the chest. However, does that really change the situation?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">With this, a contradiction is born. One that overturns all of our assumptions up until now...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Is the change really that great? I look forward to hearing it. Well then, this contradiction, why don't you show it to me? With evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which piece of evidence shows the contradiction that arises from the order of the wounds?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence shows the huge contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I have absolutely no idea what you are trying to say.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm sorry, me too...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Same here!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...M-Me too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwaaah! <thought>So it wasn't this!? ...It is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she suffered the head wound. And thus, a major contradiction is born within that piece of evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. There was no contradiction after all, was there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">On the contrary, Judge Courtney. If the victim sustained her head wound before she was stabbed in the chest... ...a huge contradiction arises.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young. According to this... ...the head wound was postmortem.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">But that's not what the raincoat shows...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly, it's the exact opposite.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Bailiff! Hurry and summon Dr. Bonnie Young at once!  Until we hear what she has to say, we cannot close the curtains on this case!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Yes, ma'am! Understood!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Dr. Young is a busy person. It will take some time for her to arrive. In the meantime... let us try viewing this case from another angle. There's something that's been on my mind. One of the key figures in this case... The "Conductor". We still don't know who that person is.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Now that you mention it! Even after our investigation, we still have no idea who it is.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Conductor has come up time and time again during this hearing. However, at this point in time, their identity remains a mystery. How about it? Do you have any ideas?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm still not sure at the moment. However... ...there is someone I have in mind. A certain individual involved with this case, who might know something about it.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Who's that...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste! I demand your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Don't say such a stupid thing! Why would you suspect pops!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you trying to cast suspicion towards the Chairman of the P.I.C.? Do you understand... what that means?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Status and prestige mean nothing before the truth. That man is trying to pin the crime on Kay! The evidence that was in Kay's possession: the ticket stub, the mask, the corsage... These items did not come into her possession out of her own volition. By some method, that man purposely planted them on her personage.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........ It is hard to believe such a sudden accusation... but I'll ask just in case. Why... would he do that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Obviously, to direct suspicion towards Kay. I succeeded in drawing out those words from him earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Chairman, your response?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you too shocked to speak?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....And what of it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said, "What of it?" You say that you drew out some words from me, but you don't have a shred of proof, y'know? No one else heard it but you. It just doesn't work like that, y'see. Or do you have something else? Y'know, some kind of basis for your argument?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This confidence... He also showed it at the cell...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I would like you to explain once more. I trust we have your permission, Mr. Chairman.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">But of course. I'm pretty interested in this matter myself, y'know. I'd like to know just what part of me semes criminal to Edgeworth. There's no one as honest as I am, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>How can he say that with a straight face...?</thought> Let's start from the top... The fact that the auction was held in this room is a cause for suspicion. This is the P.I.C. meeting room. I imagine it would be difficult for non-members to enter.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">That's why... all the members have keycards, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think we can assume that multiple auctions have been held here before. Therefore, suspecting a member of the P.I.C. would be...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-Yes. Because the Conductor had to have been a P.I.C. member.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wait! Nooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha... <thought>What was that all about!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-What do I do, pops? I just helped the enemy!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha ha. Sebastian really is an idiot, y'know. But y'see, Edgeworth, I'm not the only one with access, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Indeed... There are eleven members in the P.I.C. Even if we rule out the victim, Ms. Crane... there are still ten potential suspects.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. Everyone, just calm down, y'know? Edgeworth, is that all you got? Where's the evidence to suspect me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Oh? So you've fallen silent. But you've gone too far, y'see. I won't forgive you anymore. It's too late for regrets, y'know? I'm a very important man, y'see. Former Chief Prosecutor and Chairman of the P.I.C.!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It's fine if you're not prepared to face the fire, y'know. 'Cause y'see... ...either way, it won't make any difference.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You've been rambling on for quite a while about the most trivial details, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Now then. If there are any contradictions, be my quest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>How can that be considered a testimony!? There must be a contradiction somewhere...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">That person... He's very important, isn't he? Mr. Edgeworth... It's alright. Let's just give up... Surely, I must have killed her... I can even remember it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't be tied down by your muddled memories. If you want to believe in something... ...believe in your own innocence. Believe me, who believes in you!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>My opponent is the P.I.C. Chairman. Taking him down won't be easy. However... ...he has underestimated me. If I can take advantage of that...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You've been rambling on for quite a while about the most trivial details, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If these trivial details create contradictions in the case, we cannot call it the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It's fine, as long as the rest of the case makes sense, y'know. Every case is going to have a small contradiction or two, y'see. But, if we get bogged down by the details, we won't be able to arrest the criminal. Trials would go on forever, y'see. You, of all people, should understand, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't, that's why I'm asking you.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah, young folks these days. Anyways, you were rambling on about stuff...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Like the location of the murder, the order of the wounds and... Hrmm, what else was there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The autopsy report, and the questions about the Conductor. ...Were you even listening?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Talk is cheap, y'know. I was listening, y'see. But I didn't think much of it, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't think much of it, even after I brought up all those issues...? Perhaps your judgement needs to be questioned, rather than my ability as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha. That's a good one, Edgeworth. But y'see...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It just doesn't matter, y'know. 'Cause y'see, none of that means anything, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How can you say it doesn't matter!? Are you trying to suppress the truth!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well, y'see. It simply doesn't matter as much as you say it does, y'know. Y'see, Edgeworth. You're only saying it matters to avoid the real issue here.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Think about it. We've got the suspect herself saying she killed the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's all that matters, y'see. She'll even get a lighter sentence with her confession, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wouldn't call that a confession. You probably forced her to say it, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Even if you say that, y'know. What do you think, Courtney?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, sir. There is no doubt, she confessed to her own sin.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'see, Edgeworth. I know you want to believe in Kay Faraday. But, y'know, to deny her own confession, I'm not sure what to make of that, y'see. It just means that you don't really trust her, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you say...!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Oh my, what scary eyes you have. Please don't devour me. Ah ha ha ha...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There is no way there is a contradiction in a testimony like this. He has underestimated me. If I can take advantage of that...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It may be true she confessed, however, that does not make it the truth! She is suffering from memory loss. So we must question the credibility of her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Even if you say that, y'know, it still won't solve anything. What good will it do to deny her confession? Sounds like nonsense to me. Wanna try asking her again? I think she'll just say that she's the murderer again, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Very well. Let's try asking her again, one last time. I'd like to hear from Kay herself. Whether or not she is the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh...? From... me?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Will that be alright? If this goes poorly, it will be quite unfavorable for you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do not mind. However... I shall ask Kay the question myself.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">......I'm moved to tears, y'know. Oh, how touching, y'know, how very touching! Fine then, I'll let you ask her. However, I have one condition. If all this proves to be a waste of time... ...then that will be the end of it. How's that sound?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">The end... of the hearing?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. It seems you can be smart once in a while, Sebastian. In other words, y'see, if she confesses again... ...Kay Faraday will be found, beyond a shadow of a doubt, guilty. Yup. It's a fine idea.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Guilty, beyond a shadow of a doubt?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yeah, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's harsh... but either way, if I do nothing, she'll be declared guilty.</thought> Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know what I'm asking of you is unreasonable, but please, I want you to answer me. It doesn't matter how tiny it is. Do you... Do you remember anything? Anything that would prove your innocence...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Why? Why would you go that far, for me...? I... I can't do it. .....I'm sorry. .....I'm too scared to remember. Because... I might have done something even worse. If that were the case... ...I would only make things worse for you, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay Faraday must have been a despicable criminal... Someone who betrayed your trust...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....Don't worry. We've only known each other for a short while... but I know you very well. I'd even say that I know you better than yourself, now that you've lost your memories. You cannot possibly be the culprit. Because, your true identity is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. I would like you to look at this. This is your true identity!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I'm sorry, I don't remember anything...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So this wasn't related at all...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... I think I don't want to remember anything after all! I might have done something even worse than murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. Don't worry!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the Great Thief Yatagarasu. The Yatagarasu is a noble thief who would never stoop to murder.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...! .........................No. It's useless. After all...! No matter what, that memory still remains... This image that's stuck in my head... I just can't get rid of it! That means, I must have...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no clear evidence to prove that you're the culprit, besides your own confession. Remember what I said? You must believe in yourself. Or perhaps... you cannot trust my words?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.....No. That's not it. It's because, you are... trying to save someone like me. You've already lost so much... All for my sake... I can't bear it anymore... Please... Please just give up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see now..... I thought it was strange. The reason you were acting like you wanted to be found guilty... ...was because you were concerned about me... That is just like you, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's because... you're a good person, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately... I may fall short of your expectations. I am not trying to be a good person. No matter how much you may want me to give up... I'll keep trying to save you. That is the nature of who I am. Whether or not it is a burden for you is none of my concern.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, believe in yourself once more. You are a noble Great Thief. What you should be doubting is your memory of committing the murder. That is my wish, above all else. ......Please.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I........ ......! AAAAAHHHHHH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What is it? Did you remember something?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">If she remembers something now... Ha ha ha, it'd be like a bad movie.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">........Bull.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">B... Bull...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please ask her to clarify.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">E-Erm, well, Kay. What do you mean by "bull"...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I remember now! The person in the red raincoat had that with her! The stuffed bull doll! I'm certain of it!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that tr-</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Is that true, Defendant!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes, your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Court hereby accepts the defendant's statement as a new piece of testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Quit messing around, Courtney. A testimony like that cannot be accepted, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Your objection has been noted, sir. However, testimony about the victim's belongings...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...has been lacking up until now.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Nevertheless, y'know. Her vague memories cannot be trusted, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Her memories are vague? That would be bad for us as well. Didn't you say this earlier yourself, Mr. Chairman? Since we have the suspect's confession, we don't need to worry about the trivial details. If we decide to doubt her memories... ...then we must also doubt her confession, which is the main foundation of our case. Are you willing to do that, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....Aah. You're right. Well, never mind then. I shall leave it to you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>W-We did it. It was touch and go for a while there, though... ...however, those words of Judge Courtney just now... It almost feels as if... she is on our side...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, do you know anything about this stuffed animal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The stuffed animal Kay spoke of must have been this. We found it in the storeroom. It is believed to be one of the items for the auction.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hm? Do you know something about it, Justine?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">N-No... It's just a bit different from what I imagined.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Indeed... it's certainly not what I would have expected the victim to be carrying. Let's examine every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A cherry blossom petal is stuck in its soft fur. Speaking of which, there were also some stuck on the red raincoat...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A cherry tree... Wasn't there one blossoming on the viewing platform?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It seems safe to assume this was taken outside. <thought>However... why would the victim be carrying something like this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">The left horn is missing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. There's a hole in this stuffed animal. It seems this hole is where the horn is inserted into.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess its head isn't stuffed with cotton. I wonder what's inside?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Perhaps I should examine the other side.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The right horn seems to be fine... but the entire balance feels a bit off.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This horn... It looks like you can move it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What was that buzzing sound...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems this toy is equipped with a recording device.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is this... the moment of the murder!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Who could have recorded something like this?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Th... This is... There ain't no doubt about it! This here was what I heard!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A cherry blossom petal is stuck in its soft fur. According to Kay's story, this had been dropped under the cherry tree. So it's no wonder that a cherry blossom petal had gotten caught in there.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The left horn is missing. Although I am curious as to the whereabouts of the missing horn... Even if we were to find it, repairing it would be no easy task.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We can play back the audio that was recorded by twisting this horn.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We cannot verify when these voices were recorded. It's also possible that they aren't related to the case at all. If only we had some video as well...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's hogwash! I'm tellin' ya, that right there was the conversation that I heard! The victim was holdin' on to it, right? I reckon it must've been recorded when she got attacked!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That certainly is a possibility... However, your testimony alone is insufficient. I require something with a little more credibility.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Again. Her words... It almost sounds as if she's trying to give me advice...</thought> Judge Courtney. There's no mistake that those voices were from the incident. Please recall the audio that was recorded by the stuffed animal. "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." If we compare this part of the recording with a certain piece of evidence... we can prove it. <thought>This evidence shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. What do you think of this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Presenting something that has nothing to do with the recording will not do you any good.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uugh! <thought>I could've sworn it was this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Is there really evidence to prove that the voices were recorded during the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The autopsy report? And exactly what part of the autopsy report shows that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This part shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you look at this part of the autopsy report, I think you will understand...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Specifically which part are you referring to?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm. Around here?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Even if you ask me, it will not do you any good.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwaah! <thought>I guess it wasn't here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why don't we listen to the contents of the recording one more time? There might be something important.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. And it's also not too late to look over the autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. What part of the autopsy report shows that the voices were recorded during the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I remember clearly what that voice said... "You can't hide that burn from me." On the victim's hand, there was a burn mark.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Indeed... it just happened to match up, y'see. But, what of it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">According to Kay's testimony, the victim had been holding the stuffed animal. And, it just happened to record a characteristic of the victim. Namely, the burn.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">That's just a coincidence! I mean... it could happen, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I do not think so. It is hard to believe that all of this is simply a coincidence. The voices on the stuffed animal were most likely recorded during the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">One of these voices must belong to the true culprit. From what we've heard, it must have been the one who was doing most of the talking.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But what's the point? In the end, we still can't tell their gender or identity, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, because they had been using voice changers. It can't be helped.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems the situation has become quite clear. The conversation Ms. Hart overheard was between the culprit and Ms. Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">...That's what I've been tellin' you from the start.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And from this, we will understand a new fact.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please enlighten us then. I trust you have no objections, Mr. Chairman.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Do what you want.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">According to Ms. Hart's testimony, just before the incident... ...two people came up from the auction hall, using the lift. It must have been the Conductor and one of the auction guests. They probably went there to settle the payment after winning a bid. And then, it was there that the crime was carried out... Since the auction continued after the crime took place... ...we are led to a single truth! <thought>This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The culprit of this case is Jill Crane. It has to be her!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. This is not the time to be joking around!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>As I thought, this wasn't... If I organize all the information I've acquired up until now, I can only arrive at the one answer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Just what is this new fact you are talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim of this case was the Conductor!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's all fine and dandy, but the auction still went on after the murder, ya know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Nnghhoooh! <thought>It seems that was wrong... If I organize all the information I've acquired up until now, I can only arrive at the one answer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Just what is this new fact you are talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since the Conductor was the only one who could keep the auction going... ...we can conclude that the deceased victim could not have been the Conductor.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Umm, Justine...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please be quiet here. Okay?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the Conductor was not the victim, then they must have been the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please wait. That alone is insufficient.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course. Even I do not intend to rely only upon the process of elimination.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Certain traces left at the crime scene led me to believe that the culprit is the Conductor.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, please show it to us.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What were the traces left at the crime scene that let me deduce the culprit is the Conductor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the piece of evidence that shows the culprit is the Conductor.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Umm, I don't quite understand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Even if you don't understand, everyone else certainly does.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I think there are people besides my idiot son who don't understand, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>It seems that wasn't it... If the culprit was the Conductor, they would have wanted to hide something... I just have to present that!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. If you say the culprit is the Conductor... ...could you present evidence to prove that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I will show you that piece of evidence right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room. In doing so, we were led to believe the meeting room had been the scene of the crime. It was a ruse by true culprit. To hide the blood that had fallen from the storeroom!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So we wouldn't find out about the existence of the black market auction... Correct?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. If the culprit had been unrelated to the auction, there would have been no need to do such a thing. Ergo, the culprit could have only been the Conductor!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then... Do you have any idea as to who the Conductor might possibly be?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The auction hall is at the P.I.C. meeting room, and furthermore, there is a storeroom above it. The Conductor must have been, at the very least, a member of the P.I.C.!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">So..... ...in other words, you suspect me, I take it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't it natural to suspect you, the one with the most authority in the P.I.C.?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...You are quite capable. I'll give you that much, at least. But y'know, like I said before, you're far too naïve. .....You have nothing, y'know? There's no evidence that proves I am the culprit, y'see. If, by some chance, you do have evidence, then why don't you present it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Urk...! Do I have evidence that Blaise is the culprit...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. There is evidence. Evidence that you are the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Oooh. Then, why don't you show it to me? This so-called evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste. This piece of evidence proves that you are the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth. And what about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste, don't you understand? The meaning of this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Weeell. Y'know, I can't say I do. I mean, it doesn't look like it's related at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwaaah! <thought>So this wasn't it...! Blaise Debeste has to be the culprit. However, do I have any evidence to prove it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth. There's no evidence to prove that I'm the culprit, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blaise himself has suggested that he is the criminal. He's been showing that strange self-confidence for awhile now. He knows that there is not a single piece of evidence left behind to incriminate him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ha ha ha... If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned, Edgeworth. ...Juuust kidding, I always wanted to say that, y'know. Well then, Courtney...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I, I-I-I-I-I reckon! I just remembered somethin' too!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Bwuh? You also lost your memories?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Naw, that ain't it. Somethin' just popped into my head right now!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. Please tell us.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Courtney. Could you tell me what you are doing?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth will not give up until we have destroyed every last possibility. I'm destroying every possibility. So that he will never oppose us again.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Justine...! I don't really know what's going on, but well said! Pops, I'm gonna help too! After all, he's the one who's wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Fine then. Let's hear what she has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, Ms. Hart. Please proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">S-Sure thing! Just leave it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Please make sure you only tell the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ain't that a matter of course! I'm a bona fide journalist of justice, ya know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>.....Somehow I feel uneasy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y'all sayin' the culprit was the Conductor, right? That means, the victim was a customer. Now, here's where it gets a mite strange. Ya see, there were 11 people at the auction. When the auction continued after the incident... ...I went straight on over and snuck a peek down below.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-You don't mean.....</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's exactly what I mean. All 11 people were still there, present 'n acocunted for.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-aaaaaaaaaaaat!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you sure about that?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Sure I'm sure. I saw it with my own two eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Umm... so it started with 11 people. And there were still 11 people after the murder... Was it a ghost!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, Sebastian. Normally, a prosecutor would call that a contradiction, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Were there really no changes in the auction at all?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Really! I'm tellin' ya! The auction just went on like normal. Ah. But... there was one itty bitty thing, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was it?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ya know those hammers ya always see at an auction? Like the one that lady is usin' over there.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...An auction gavel... perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yup, that's the one! All of a sudden, I couldn't hear the sound no more. It'd been bangin' away just prior to it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The sound of the gavel? Does that have anything to do with the case?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If Ms. Hart's testimony is the truth, then this matter has taken a grave turn. If the victim was neither the Conductor nor a customer... ...the very foundation of Prosecutor Edgeworth's reasoning would collapse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Justice prevails, as they say! I hope you've learned your lesson, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... There really is nothing we can do...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's not over yet. Some mysteries still remain. I have to think. If I don't, then Kay will be...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Did you get the answer you wanted this time? Well then, a deal's a deal...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please wait, Mr. Chairman. I believe it is still too early to make a judgment. There are still... a few mysteries left in this case. Until we have solved them all, we cannot call this a complete victory.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was expecting you to shout... ..."<cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn>" ...like you always do.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-Yes. Of course. <thought>Once again... Judge Courtney has come to my aid...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well then, what is it? What sort of mysteries are left?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well, of course, there's the contradiction in the autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...That kind of thing...</line>
<line speaker="Officer">I've brought her in!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Wh-What's wrong? Why were we suddenly called here!? Did someone suddenly get sick!? I-I'll begin preparing a compress, stat... Ouch! "What'd you call me here for? Did something happen?"</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Dr. Young, Ms. Jenson, you have my gratitude for taking the trouble to come here. This won't take long. So please relax.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"Tell me what in blazes is going on!?"</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ha ha ha... Of course. We called you here because something came up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney... Just what are you planning?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Bonnie Young! Under the Divine Rule of Law, please answer truthfully. There were no mistakes in your autopsy report, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Granny would never make a mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's certainly strange.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Huh...? What's strange?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This court has found an error in Dr. Young's autopsy report. Dr. Young, please tell the truth. Did you falsify the autopsy report?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">That's terrible! How can you accuse her of that...!? "I have no idea what you are talking about. Why would I do such a thing in the first place?"</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">To protect the true culprit... Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"Watchu talkin' bout!? I would never do such a thing!"</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">How strange. In that case, why would there be an error in the autopsy report, I wonder. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Oh? I expected you to press into her statement like you normally do.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why is she taking control of the situation and trying to help me...? I don't know what her goal is... but I must play along.</thought> If the autopsy report you gave to Sebastian had been authentic... ...then the error should not have been there.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">W-Wait a minute! I didn't do anything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is what we will figure out from this point on. Firstly... Dr. Young. I'd like to hear your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Why do you want to hear her testimony? It would be pointless!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will be the one who decides whether or not it is pointless. Not you.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">There are patients waiting for us! ...B-But Granny... Ouch! Anyways, we don't have time for this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is there any way I could convince you? This is of the utmost importance.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">...Mr. Miles Edgeworth, Granny says she'll testify. So please, try to finish this quickly. If we don't return soon, there will be people in terrible suffering!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And yet, you were lollygagging about on the viewing platform earlier...</thought> I promise you. This won't take long. <thought>Only if she tells me the truth, of course.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Karin">There are no mistakes in Granny's autopsy reports!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes! That's right, y'know. There's no way she would falsify it, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Under the name of the Goddess of Law, do you swear that this testimony is the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Of course! Granny would never tell a lie...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We were asking Dr. Young. We do not need to hear from a third party.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I-I'm not a third party! I'm on Granny's side! "If you raise an objection to my testimony, you'd best prepare yourself... you ex-prosecutor!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I will definitely expose the contradiction in the autopsy report!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Karin">There are no mistakes in Granny's autopsy reports!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're saying there is no way Dr. Young could have made a mistake?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Of course! Doctors can't afford to make mistakes. This is a world where just one misdiagnosis can end a long career. I know that my Granny, at least, would never... "If I did something like that, you think they'd still let me run a hospital?"</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"I've been working with corpses longer than you've been alive."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So in your long career, you've never once made a mistake?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"A doctor's only as good as the length of their track record."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. If we're just talking about a lengthy track record, that former Chief Prosecutor has one too. And yet, his actual abilities don't seem to measure up. I hope that you're not the same as well.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ouch... That's a low blow, y'know. But y'know, Edgeworth. I don't make mistakes either, y'see. 'Cuase y'see, before I can make a mistake, those around me will have already made it instead. Y'see, I don't have time for mistakes. It's quite amazing, y'know. It must be karma.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"You can't compare a Chief Prosecutor with a doctor. You really can't..."</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"There's no way I'd make a mistake in writing the autopsy report" ...Ouch!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim wore this raincoat after suffering a blow to the head. And yet, there was not a single drop of blood on the front of the raincoat. Therefore, it is impossible for the head wound to have been "postmortem!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Errm. Well, that's... Ouch! "I don't need you to tell me that! That's what I wrote down from the very beginning!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The autopsy report says, "the head wound was postmortem." That's completely different!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Err... Y-Yeah. "I relayed to Karin what to put down in the autopsy report. After that, it was none of my beeswax!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Relayed to Karin? Please elaborate on that.</line>
<line speaker="Change this statement to">""I relayed everything to Karin. After that, it was none of my beeswax!""</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"I relayed everything to Karin. After that, it was none of my beeswax!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I would like to verify once again what you saw when you examined the body.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Errrm, like we said... Ouch! Oooh... Well, about that... "She was done in by a thump to her noggin."</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Dr. Young, do you know when that happened?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"Before she died, of course. The wounds on her chest were postmortem. That's what I related to Karin, so that's what should've been written in the report!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's what you "relayed" to her... eh? I'm finally beginning to see the truth.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Karin">"I got nothing to gain from falsifying the autopsy report."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may have nothing to gain, but how about your granddaughter?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Me? Th-There isn't anything I could gain! "If Karin had something to gain, then that girl of yours might have something too. How dare you accuse my little girl, who has never done harm to anybody..." Yeah! Aren't you ashamed of yourself!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She should address those words to Blaise, instead of me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Karin">"I swear that the autopsy report wasn't falsified."</line>
<line speaker="Karin">...Is what she says. See? There's nothing strange at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you notice anything strange when you were performing the autopsy?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I wonder..... Huh? What is it, Granny? "A strange man came by."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who are you calling strange!?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"He wore some really strange clothes. He even had a frilly thing around his neck."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"Even though he was about to get canned... ...he still tried to run a muck during my autopsy... I'm talking about you! You frilly red brute!"</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm, I see. So Mr. Edgeworth is a strange frilly red brute...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay, please don't only remember odd things about me.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... It doesn't look like Granny is lying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. <thought>Ms. Jenson is the one who is relying Dr. Young's words. I'll have to confirm whether or not Ms. Jenson is telling us the truth.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dr. Young, please confirm what this autopsy report says with your own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Ah! I'll read it out for you... Ouch!</line>
<line speaker="Young">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"This autopsy report wasn't written by me!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh... What! What do you mean!?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">...I don't know! B-But Granny! I... I can't say that!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Jenson. If you are trying to keep the truth in the dark, then... ...in place of the Goddess of Law, I shall hear your confession.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Judge Courtney is talking with Dr. Young in private.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What...! Is that true? Understood. I shall convey your words to everyone else, Dr. Young. "I properly relayed the autopsy report orally to that child. It seems my granddaughter must have mucked it up when she was writing it down!"</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow...! She mimicked her voice perfectly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...There was no need for her to go that far, though.</thought> In other words... the contents of the autopsy report had been falsified... ...by your hand, Ms. Jenson!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">......Oooh! I, I...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">With that, we've proven that the wound on her head came first, followed by her chest wound. Ms. Jenson, why did you falsify the autopsy report!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hold on a second. She never said she falsified it, y'know? She just made a teeny tiny mistake when she wrote it down. "Postmortem" and "antemortem" sound kinda similar, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They are complete opposites! That is the very definition of falsification!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Jenson, why would you lie...?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Kay... Ouch! "I want you to tell me too. Why you would do something like that...?" Granny...! But, I.....!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Because you falsified the autopsy report, Kay fell under suspicion. Tell me why you did it!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I, I... can't say! I just can't say it...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Not "I don't want to say", but "I can't say"...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You're all a bunch of bullies, y'know. Ganging up on this poor girl who loves her grandmother so... She is totally unrelated to this. I think we can forgive her for one tiny mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That won't do. Aren't you the one with the most to lose if she testifies?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hmm? What are you saying? Y'see, as a "former" prosecutor, you'll have to speak a little more clearly, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. As you wish, I shall answer clearly. Ms. Jenson played an essential role in this case!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Jenson was the true culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha! That's a good one. Then, how about we arrest her immediately?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>As I thought, this wasn't it... Who did Ms. Jenson falsify the report for...? If I think about it like that, then I should understand Ms. Jenson's role in the case!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth. How about you quit joking around and clearly say what's on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Jenson was the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's right, y'know. Everyone's getting on her case for such a tiny mistake. In a way, the true victim of the case is this poor girl, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>That wasn't what I meant.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Ms. Jenson is still alive. Wouldn't that mean that she's not a victim?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. <thought>Who did Ms. Jenson falsify the report for...? If I think about it like that, then I should understand Ms. Jenson's role in the case!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth. How about you quit joking around and clearly say what's on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Jenson falsified the autopsy report in order to assist the true culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Ah... Owwwwwchhh!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha! That girl is an accomplice? What's your basis for that claim?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It was impossible for a single person to commit this crime in the first place. The crime could not have been committed without at least two people. Namely because...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...if there hadn't been an accomplice, the victim could not have been moved!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The victim is a woman. Wouldn't it be possible for someone to move her on their own?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwaaargh! <thought>Certainly, that's true. Recall the facts before and after the incident. If the victim also one of the participants... ...that creates a contradiction in her testimony. And we are led to only one answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">There's no basis that there had been an accomplice, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. There is a basis.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...if there was no accomplice, the autopsy report could not have been falsified!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Although that might be true... ...isn't that a little weak as the basis for there being an accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>It seems that wasn't it... Recall the facts before and after the incident. If the victim also one of the participants... ...that creates a contradiction in her testimony. And we are led to only one answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">There's no basis that there had been an accomplice, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. There is a basis.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...if the Conductor was the culprit, and one of the auction guests was the victim... ...it would contradict the witness's testimony that there were eleven people after the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What now? Ya got a problem with my testimony!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Not at all. Rather, it is because I believe your testimony, that's why an accomplice must exist.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">So, you still won't admit that your reasoning is wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Up until now, we had not even considered the possibility of an accomplice. However, if there had been an accomplice, it changes the entire story completely. If the accomplice took the murdered auction guest's place... ...then the number of people remains eleven!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Oooh... I see now. So that's what you're thinking. But, y'know, wouldn't that have been quickly discovered?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ms. Jenson and the victim have similar physiques. If she wore the victim's mask, she could have easily taken her place. Ms. Jenson, did you switch places with the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I, I...! ...I wouldn't...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who was the Conductor...? In other words, tell me who was the true culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I-I can't! I mean... That would also cause trouble for Granny...! Ah... Ouch! But, Granny...! "I will accept whatever wrongs you may have done. Just tell me everything." G... Gr...... Gr... Gra-Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I thought... it appears you really were the accomplice.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Jenson... Why...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Jenson. ...Would you please tell us?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes... It's OK, Granny. I'm fine now. I... switched places with the victim, Ms. Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So you admit to being the Conductor's accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes... I helped out the Conductor. I don't really know why, but for some reason... ...the Conductor was expecting to be attacked by Ms. Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The Conductor expected an attack from the victim...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Karin">They were so sure it was going to happen, that they came up with a plan to counter it. A way to beat the victim at her own game. And that's when I was called in. I was told to wait in the storeroom before the auction begin.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Whoa there! You ain't foolin' my eyes! If you were waitin' in the storeroom, I reckon I would've bumped into you! After all, I'd been up in that storeroom the entire auction!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I'm telling the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I wonder about that, y'know. Can we really believe a girl who would falsify a report?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... There should've been many places to hide in that storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Then by all means, tell me. Where did our little nurse hide!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Jenson hid here!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you think a person could hide in a place like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. I don't.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I would like you to answer seriously.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>I knew this wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why don't we take a look at the things that were in the storeroom one more time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. There shouldn't have been that many places where one could hide in.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well, Edgeworth. Where was this little nurse hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She hid inside this costume drunk.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">A costume trunk... eh?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ah! Now that ya mention it, that box was already there before I snuck in! I figure I would hide in there myself, but it was wrapped up nice 'n' tight with a chain. And it was locked too, so I had to give it up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suspect that when you sneaked into the room, Ms. Jenson was already inside the trunk.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes... it would've been bad if one of the guests from the auction had opened the bid. After instructing me to hide inside... ...the Conductor wrapped a chain around the costume trunk. I think they went downstairs using the lift shortly thereafter. It was right before the auction...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So then, when the auction began... ...only you and Ms. Hart were in the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes, that should be right...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The auction had been going on as usual, but... ...when a certain participant made the winning bid, the Conductor committed the crime. Ms. Hart must have heard the altercation that occurred then.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">You betcha! I was tremblin' behind that there statue the whole time though!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Following the altercation, Jill Crane was murdered. After killing Jill Crane, the Conductor carried her body to the costume trunk... ...and Ms. Jenson, who had been hiding in the trunk, was made to take Ms. Crane's place. The victim's body was placed inside the costume trunk. The Conductor then took Ms. Jenson, who had been made to look like Jill Crane... ...and returned to the auction hall as if nothing had happened. Was this roughly what happened in the storeroom during the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes... That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Pullin' the old switcheroo with one of the auction guests... Ain't that impossible? That gal and the murder victim are two completely different people, ya know. Don't ya reckon one of the other participants would've noticed and caused a ruckus?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not at all. The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ms. Jenson addressed herself by the victim's name.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ain't this an auction where y'all hide yer faces with a mark? I reckon they wouldn't give out their names!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>She's completely right... Her face was hidden by a mask. What else would have been necessary to change into Ms. Crane? That's the only thing I have to consider. I should already know the answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey, City Boy. Tell it to me straight. Why ain't nobody find out that they switched places?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...most likely Ms. Jenson acted like the victim. Since her face was hidden, that's probably why no one noticed.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ya dummy! Even if her face was hidden, they still wore different clothes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>It seems that was wrong... Her face was hidden by a mask. What else would have been necessary to change into Ms. Crane? That's the only thing I have to consider. I should already know the answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey, City Boy. Tell it to me straight. Why ain't nobody find out that they switched places?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique. Furthermore, there was a rule requiring a mask to be worn during the auction. If their clothes were the same, I doubt anyone would've noticed she was a different person.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">...Yes. I blended right in. I borrowed Ms. Crane's clothes and... Ouch! "You mustn't embarrass the dead like that!" I know... I also thought it was pretty heartless to leave her exposed like that... So when the Conductor wasn't looking, I covered her up in the raincoat that was up for auction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So she was the one who put the red raincoat on the victim...</thought> And then, the auction resumed as if nothing had happened.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I reckon I took the picture of her in the red raincoat after that. That'd make all the facts line up.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">After I took the photo, I went over to the lift to sneak a peek down below. I witnessed the 11 participants, and then I high-tailed it back behind the statue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't tell me... You were hiding there the entire time until we found you?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Nah, that's... How should I put it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...? What is it? Did something happen?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-So something did happen!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I-It ain't no big deal! Kinda embarrassin' to say, though. There was this huge *THUMP* sound all of a sudden... I was a liiiittle surprised by that. It was right after I had just witnessed a murder, so I was shakin' in my foots... My hear sorta tightened up, and I was off to la-la land... When I woke up, it was already the next day, 'round the time y'all came by the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So there was a large sound... Ms. Hart, I take it you do not know what transpired in the storeroom beyond this point?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I-I guess. But after the auction, all the masks were properly returned... So I reckon the participants had exited through the storeroom, just like I done said!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Ms. Jenson, what were your actions after the auction resumed?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I took the victim's place and participated in the auction. The Conductor instructed me to win the the bid for the costume trunk... ...because the body was inside it. It would have been bad if another auction guest won the bid for it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't realize the box was empty?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">No. We only found out when I came up to the storeroom to pay the bill. The Conductor was with me and told me to go search for her immediately. And then... I found another girl collapsed in front of the ladder!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay...</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes. She probably fell down from the rood and lost consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Maybe the victim left the hatch open when she went up to the rooftop.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I understand now. Kay was surprised at seeing the collapsed victim and did not notice the open hatch. She must have missed her footing and fell down into the storeroom. Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That mighta been it. Though I reckon it'd be kinda pathetic to faint over something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When Ms. Jenson found the unconscious Kay... ...Ms. Hart was also unconscious behind the statue. The situation is becoming clearer to me. Ms. Jenson, please continue your story.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">After I found Kay and the victim, I... put them both in the trunk. If the customers at the auction found out, there would've been a huge commotion.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was this an order from the Conductor as well?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes, it was... But, since I secretly decided to put the raincoat on Ms. Crane... ...I had to dispose of the raincoat without the Conductor noticing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... So the Conductor didn't anticipate the raincoat becoming another piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">And, finally... ...we dressed Ms. Crane in a spare Conductor's outfit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. In doing so, you made the victim appear as if she was the Conductor.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">In the end, the auction ended without anyone noticing anything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Ms. Jenson. Your crimes have become clear. If you know anything else, please hold nothing back.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I want to help you more... but that is all I know... Umm, if I had to say, there is just one thing that bothers me. When I took Ms. Crane's place, I borrowed her clothes... ...but there was no way for me to borrow her hair... Ouch! "What kinda coroner's assistant goes around stealin' a corpse's hair?"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I would think that robbing the deceased of their clothes would be questionable enough...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Karin">Both the color and the length of our hair is different, so I was worried about how to disguise it. However, the Conductor even had a wig prepared for me. In fact... he had two of them. Inside the costume trunk, there was both a straight wig and a wavy wig.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Two wigs...? Why were there two?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Who knows...? Maybe it was a precaution, in case the victim had changed her hairstyle...? I ended up using the straight wig to match Ms. Crane's hair.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So that means the wavy wig was left unused...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Is that really all you know?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Yes... Yup, that's really all I know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that means you don't know who the Conductor is?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">...I'm sorry. I only knew that person as the auction conductor... I never saw that person without a mask on. The Conductor seemed to be on guard... towards everybody.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Nngh! <thought>At this rate...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth, is that all you've got? Even if that little nurse is an accomplice, it changes absolutely nothing, y'know? In the end, the true culprit is still Kay Faraday. All you did was add another criminal, y'know. The rule of law cannot be overturned. At least, not for your sake.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this as far as I go? Am I unable... to save Kay...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska...! Why are you here!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Didn't I tell you, Miles Edgeworth? Wherever there is a case, I will follow.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor von Karma... Your hard work is most appreciated.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">However... Don't get the wrong idea. I only came here to find out the truth behind what happened to Kay Faraday. ...I don't plan on forgiving you for abandoning the prosecutor's path!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.....You should thank your "former" subordinate. He gave me some valuable information which may save Kay Faraday.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>Detective Gumshoe did...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Listen well, Miles Edgeworth! This will be the final piece of evidence... Jill Crane..... suffered the wound on her head first!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">............</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, someone say something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm. U-Umm... Well, I hate to say it, but... ...we already proved that.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">......Already, proved?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Well, just a few minutes ag- AARRGH!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You should've told me sooner!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You're the one who barged in here and started talking!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, then... does that mean you've found out what the murder weapon was already?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not yet.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hmph... Is that so? In that case, listen well. The victim was struck on the head with a blunt cylindrical object. The wound on her chest was suffered postmortem.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A cylindrical murder weapon...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, this report of yours, I trust it's accurate, of course?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">These were the results of two independent autopsies, carried out by two respected doctors.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's reassuring... but, it's too bad. You have no right to investigate this ca-</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Interpol is after the black market auctions. And I'm the prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The victim particpated in the auction. Therefore, it is only natural for me to investigate. Especially now that she's been murdered.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....I see, I see. Clever girl, little Von Karma.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Then it has been settled. The victim died from blunt force trauma to the head.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This candelabra inflicted the wounds on the victim's chest. Since we have proven that the cause of death was the wound she suffered on her head... ...this was probably used to disguise the cause of death.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Unfortunately... the murder weapon has yet to be found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Just knowing the shape of the murder weapon, gives me an idea as you what it might be.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey, hey! In my investigation, we didn't find any other murder weapons, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you consider the Conductor's possessions and the crime scene, the answer should be clear. The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. The murder weapon is your gavel!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I'm not sure what you're trying to say... ...but if you're suspecting me, then why don't you examine it up close and personal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th... That's won't be necessary. <thought>As I thought, that was wrong. What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Mr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Besides a judge's gavel, I can't think of anything else.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Edgeworth, there's never a dull moment with you, y'know. A judge's gavel, y'say? Sebastian, what do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Umm... I don't think so.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>I was shot down by the Debestes! What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Mr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction... Namely, an auction gavel.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">An auction gavel? We didn't find anything like that!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If the culprit is the Conductor, it is possible that the gavel may be murder weapon. However... that alone is not reason enough, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course, I have proof to back it up! This piece of evidence proves that the murder weapon is the auction gavel...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Take a look at this piece of evidence. This proves the murder weapon is the auction gavel!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth. I don't know what you're trying to say... ...but if you don't want to fall prey to my whip, then stop spouting that nonsense!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>But you already hit me, regardless! Wasn't there something different after the gavel had been used as the murder weapon? I should take another look at the evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Can you show us evidence that the auction gavel is the murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. I can and I will.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">According to Ms. Hart's testimony, after the victim had been murdered... ...it seems she suddenly stopped hearing the sound of the gavel during the auction. However, she had been able to hear it up until then. Why was that... you ask? It was because it had been used as the murder weapon and was covered in the victim's blood... ...it became necessary to dispose of it. Isn't that right? Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.........</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...I'll have a search for the murder weapon performed immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha ha! Well... Good luck with that, y'know. You've gotta work as hard as you can while you're young, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's completely confident that we won't find it...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, while the search for the murder weapon continues... I hereby call for a brief recess.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Order in the court. Prosecutor von Karma. Your report, please.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">......I have a bad news. We've searched every inch of the Grand Tower, but... ...the auction gavel was nowhere to be found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kh...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...That is most unfortunate. It seems... I am left with no choice, but to pronounce a verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well... it sure seems that way, y'know. Normally, you wouldn't commit a blunder like leaving behind the murder weapon, y'know. The best criminals would never do something like that, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Urk..... I don't have enough information! Is this as far as I can go...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. It's a shame, y'know. But it can't be helped, y'see. This takes me back, y'know. All those defendants who came to me, asking for a plea bargain. They trusted me, y'know. Told me every one of their dirty little secrets, y'see. And when it came time for the trial, I'd get them sentenced to life in prison... Th-They... were all completely dumbstruck, y'know. Each and every one of them... Ha ha ha...! Oh, how I wish you all could have seen it, y'know... th-the stupid look on their faces!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I shall hereby announce my verdict. Please humbly accept the words of the Law.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There's... nothing more I can do. With this, both Kay and I are...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">........</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If only we had some evidence...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I never thought that I would be passing judgment on you like this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this the end...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The defendant... Blaise Debeste! I hereby indict you!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">WHAAAAAAAAAT!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">..........Oh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I have here, documents regarding a certain case. The IS-7 Incident... A case that happened 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Documents... you say? Why would you suddenly...? Wait... you don't mean...! On the day of the crime, the record of your keycard being used was because...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I came to this room to fetch these documents, of course. Although... when I entered the meeting room... ...it seems it was before the black market auction had begun. At first I told you that I came to gather documents about you, Prosecutor Edgeworth... At that time, I simply could not tell you the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What are you doing, Justine!? Why are you indicting Pops!? Without any basis... th-this is slander!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That was a wonderful remark, Sebastian!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Huh? R-Really?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Of course there is a basis. During the case 18 years ago... ...Prosecutor Manfred von Karma "fabricated" information regarding the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was because the body of the sculptor, Isaac Dover, had been stolen...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Papa "fabricated" information about a body? What do you mean...!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Detective Lacer, who handled the initial investigation, reported that the body had gone missing. However, in order to deceive Prosecutor von Karma... ...there is a person who purposely did not report to him that the body had disappeared!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you say...!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That person would not forgive those who defied him, nor would he allow others to hold power. He would use any means necessary, in order to bend others to his will. And then... also 18 years ago... ...Director Young, was ordered by a certain individual to write a fake autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dr. Young was the one who wrote the autopsy report for the IS-7 Incident!?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">P-Please wait! Granny didn't do anything wrong! She was ordered by that person... She had no choice but to obey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That person...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That person... was the Chief Prosecutor at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Chief Prosecutor... 18 years ago... Y-You don't mean...!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The Chief Prosecutor... who gave Papa his first penalty...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It was none other than you! Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">............</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh... What are you saying!? Pops would never do something like that!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sebastian. We do not need your opinion right now. ...Blaise Debeste. Do you have a rebuttal?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Fabricating stuff about the body, Von Karma did all that on his own, y'know. Falsifying the autopsy report? Young. You would actually do something like that? Maaan... Y-You really did some terrible things behind my back, y'know...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Seeing as how all the parties concerned are here today, we should ask them directly.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">P-Please wait! Granny is... Ouch! Granny... I'm sorry! I... knew. That's why I...! Yup... Because if I didn't... He said he would expose you! If I didn't assist in the crime, Granny would be prosecuted! That's what that man... the Conductor... told me!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So Ms. Jenson... was being threatened. Was the Conductor who threatened you... Blaise Debeste?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Th-That... I don't know. The person who threatened me was the auction conductor. They do have similar physiques, but I never saw the person's face...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Any trivial thing is fine! Give us a characteristic that could be a clue...!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">......Th-That's right! The Conductor's mask, it exposed just a tiny part of his face. There was a tattoo there. I'm sure of it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A tattoo... you say?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I really have no idea what you're talking about, y'know. As you can see, there are clearly no tattoos on my face, y'see. So that person doesn't match me at all, y'know. The person who threatened her, this so-called Conductor... I wonder who it is, y'know. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You have incurred the wrath of the Goddess of Law. I suggest you watch what you say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hasn't he incurred your own wrath, rather than the wrath of the Goddess...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Jill Crane had been pursuing you, just as I have. ...And I will not let her death be in vain.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Crane was... y'know. You say she was pursuing me? My, my. I didn't really know her that well, y'know. I don't mind girls chasing after me, y'know. But I don't recall her ever falling for me, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...You didn't know the victim well? That is a testimony we haven't heard up until now. Before the eyes of the Goddess of Law, you shall give us an official testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...I see, I see. Everyone is bullying me. I-If you're gonna go that far... That's fine, y'see... I'll just have to make you disappear.......... Every last one of you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall cooperate with you as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If we let this opportunity slip by, I doubt we will ever get him to stand in court again. Please. do not let this chance go to waste...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes..... I promise I will live up to your expectations.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now then, Blaise Debeste, you shall testify regarding the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">The victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You intend to deny your guilt until the bitter end, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Of course he does! There's no way Pops could be the criminal! I mean, he's my pops, you know! He's the very best, like no one ever was!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes, Sebastian. If you're gonna stick up for me, be sure to have a clear basis, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">A-Alright... I got it! I'll clear you of these false accusations, Pops. I believe in you, Pops! We won't lose to someone like Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. ...You really are pure, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That person... he really loves his father, doesn't he...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">However... one must be able to accept the mistakes of their father... ...no matter how much they may look up to him...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Each person must atone for their crimes, no matter who they are.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..... <thought>This is going to be hard for Sebastian, but... ...I simply cannot overlook his father's crimes!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">The victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If she was a member of the P.I.C, then you should have been familiar with her.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well... I knew her face, but that's about it, y'know. It's not like we met each other on a regular basis, y'see...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Personally, I didn't really know her that well, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you're saying you weren't very familiar with the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's right. I didn't even know about the burn mark on Crane's hand, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't know about the burn mark...?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">W-Well, y'see... Even if I had gotten close to her, she would have disappeared soon... It's a pain to remember someone, y'know, wh-when they're must gonna disappear, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In other words, anyone who defies him disappears...</thought> I would like you to add your statement about the victim's burn to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"I only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, y'see."</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you're saying that you didn't know about the victim's burn... Is that really the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You really are persistent, y'know. Do you really think I would pay attention to every little wound on a woman's hand?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I would think the burn mark on the victim's hand would be hard to miss...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now that you mention it... Jill Crane would regularly wear gloves. I, too, did not know about the burn until the incident occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Jill Crane regularly wore gloves...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I thought so. She was probably trying to hide the burn mark, y'see? I understand how sensitive a woman can be about these things, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I would like you to add your so-called sensitive understanding of a woman to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know."</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you were aware that she always wore gloves?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well aware. Those gloves were practically her trademark, y'see. But I guess they weren't just a fashion statement. She wanted to hide her burn mark, y'know. I wonder if that girl over there is also hiding something under her bandages?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh...? I'm... not hiding anything...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I think you are, y'know. You're hiding the face of a criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Those words... should be directed at someone like you. I shall expose, here and now... the face of a true criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! How amusing. ...Go ahead and try it, if you think you can.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, Jill Crane regularly wore gloves... That's interesting... I should look over the evidence one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Either way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was there ever any trouble between you two over work?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha! Unlikely, y'know. I'm kind of important, y'see. I've gotten reports saying that she was exceedingly capable. But, y'know, our social status was completely different, y'see? So we didn't talk much, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That may be true, but it doesn't prove that you didn't kill her.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's rather prejudiced, y'know. I mean, look at you. You're taking the side of a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems Ms. Crane was the one who had an interest in you, Mr. Chairman.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, that really is a mystery. I haven't the faintest idea, y'see. So that's that. Since I had no motive, your reasoning doesn't hold, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I have no idea why she was pursuing me, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you have no clue why the victim had been pursuing you?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Nope. Not in the slightest, y'know...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It's because Pops is such a handsome man!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It's true, y'know. Women appear before me and then disappear, disappear and then reappear...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Heh heh. You guys could never reach my Pop's level of awesomeness.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It would certainly be impossible for a normal person... ...having people appear and then "physically" disappear on a daily basis.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">......Well, then. Maybe Courtney's going to disappear too?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Before that happens, I'll see to it your way of life disappears today.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I see, I see... Then I should finish it before the day's over. Keh heh heh heh heh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I will have to organize my information about the victim...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...If there's anything you don't understand, you should look over the evidence again. Perhaps you'll find a new fact this time around.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! Franziska... You're willing to help me?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I told you, I'm doing this for Kay Faraday... not you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Franziska seems to be worrying about Kay in her own way.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Jill Crane regularly wore gloves... If that is true, then it creates a huge contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Oh? A huge contradiction, y'say...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I would like you to listen to the voices recorded on this stuffed animal one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We were under the impression that this was the moment when the victim was murdered. "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." ...We thought that this statement was said by the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I-Isn't that fine? What's the problem, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... There is a huge problem with that. If the victim had been wearing gloves from the start... ...it would have been impossible to see the burn on her hand!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Gloves come off very easily, y'know? She could have taken them off during the auction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">That's not true! Ms. Crane had been wearing her gloves when I took her place! She must have been wearing them before she was murdered!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Wh... What are you saying? You! Don't you understand the position you're in!?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I-I... I'm not scared anymore! I have Granny here with me! "Blaise... Your day of reckoning has finally come."</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Somehow... it seems like you all want to disappear... permanently!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only one who will be disappearing here... is you! Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey! How dare you say that to Pops! Does it really matter if the burn mark was visible or not?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It certainly does matter. If the burn mark was visible, then we'd have a complete turnabout of the situation!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha... What are you saying!? If the victim's burn mark wasn't visible, what exactly does that tell you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim didn't have a burn mark at all!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Mr. Edgeworth. You should probably take another look at the victim's hand. No matter how you look at it, the victim definitely has a burn mark!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>He went straight to the point. If we assume that the culprit could not see the victim's burn mark... ...then what did the person who spoke in the recording see...? I should have the answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Give me a serious answer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There weren't any burn marks at all... They were all a fantasy from the very beginning!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. What do you see on Ms. Crane's hand?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mmph. <thought>There's clearly a burn mark... If we assume that the culprit could not see the victim's burn mark... ...then what did the person who spoke in the recording see...? I should have the answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Give me a serious answer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sebastian. ...Turn your way of thinking around. If the victim was wearing gloves, then her burn mark could not have been seen. In that case, whose burn mark was seen?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Someone else's... burn mark...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. The culprit must have had a burn mark as well. In other words... "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." The person who said this... was not the culprit, but the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha... Whaaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Sebastian. Could you please step aside? Edgeworth. All your reasoning up til now was just a figment of your imagination, y'know? The culprit had a burn mark? ...Where was it, y'know? If you can't answer that, then your logic doesn't hold up, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Where was the culprit's burn mark...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I wonder where the burn mark could have been...? During the auction... wasn't everyone wearing a disguise?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Indeed. During the auction, everyone should have been dressed in a particular way. <thought>If the burn mark was still visible under those conditions, then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Now, now. Why don't you show us? Where was the culprit's burn? ...You'll have to show me the proof, y'see!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Are you suggesting it will tell me where the burn mark was located? It's too bad, but I just don't understand it at all, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So I was wrong...! I need to consider the state of the Conductor when Ms. Crane saw the burn mark... If I focus on that, the location of the burn mark should logically come to light.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hey, Edgeworth. Hurry up and present it, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was what the Conductor was wearing the auction... In other words, the outfit you were wearing at the time!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha ha ha! What can you figure out from the clothes alone?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Conductor had been wearing a white suit, white gloves, and a mask... His attire had covered up most of his skin. However, according to Ms. Jenson's testimony... ...the Conductor's mask exposed a small part of his face. In addition, while she thought there had been a tattoo there... ...it's possible that she simply mistook the burn mark for a tattoo!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">! A burn mark... on his face...?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's all very scintillating, but I'm afraid you're getting excited over nothing, y'know. None of the P.I.C. members have any burn marks on their faces, y'see. Naturally, that includes me as well, y'know!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh...? P-Pops...? But.....!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Sebastian. Could you please be quiet? If you're an idiot, then act like one, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Normally, Sebastian is a nuisance to everyone around him... ...but this time, I owe him my gratitude. That reaction from Blaise's own son... It reveals the truth more clearly than anything else. Thanks to him, I am confident that my reasoning is correct! I know who that unidentified piece of evidence belongs to!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder what's wrong with that prosecutor...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Usually, Sebastian is slower to arrive at the truth than anyone else. However, this time he has probably figured it out. His own father... is a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Since he knows the truth... He's... in pain, isn't he? ...If he didn't know the truth, he could have remained blissful in his ignorance...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. We are here in order to pursue the truth. It doesn't matter what path my reasoning takes, the important thing is to arrive at the truth. Once before... when I lost faith in my reasoning, you said that to me and showed me the way. This time, I shall show you the truth. You are innocent!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I..... ...I also... want to know the truth. Mr. Edgeworth... Please tell me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... That's the spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's impossible, y'know. For all of you. I mean, just where could I possibly have a burn mark? It's nowhere to be found, y'see! There's no evidence to prove that I'm the culprit, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Th-That's right! There's no contradiction at all! There's no way there can be a contradiction! Not for my Pops...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Sebastian. I understand why you don't want to admit it. However... if you avert your eyes from the truth, you will regret it forever.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">! P-Pops... I... Just what should I do...!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">......Hah. I really wonder... Why you're such an idiot, y'know? Sebastian. If you really wanna save me, you'll have to try a little bit harder, y'see... Gotta use your head, y'know? ...Honestly, you really are a useless idiot.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">N-No way...! But, I tried real hard... I tried my best, Pops! I went to the school you told me to go, reached the top of my class, just like you told me to! Just look at this jacket! Only someone who graduates at the top of his class gets to wear it! I did everything you told me to do! That's how I got to be the best at the academy! I even won all those awards, just so I could be like you, Pops...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You really are... such an idiot, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know those gold stars you got on your tests, I made the teachers give them to you. Every speech and debate contest, all of the judges were my friends. Y'know, Sebastian. If you weren't even able to notice something like that... ...you're really not worthy of being called my son. Don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ah... ah... ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAaaaaaaaahhh!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Awww... Even my son has disappeared... Ah ha ha ha ha ha... Oh my... It's enough to make me cry, y'know. H-He was trying his best for me, and yet, he was totally useless, y'know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are truly a despicable person. As the Chairman of the P.I.C., and as a father...!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Even I feel sorry for that foolish prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Poor Mr. Prosecutor...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Blaise Debeste! You... Just what do you think of your own son!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">He's just a useless pawn, y'see. Whoa now. Maybe you should look in the mirror before you criticize me, y'know. I mean, even you... you also used Sebastian to get close to me, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I cannot deny that. However... he is not a mere "pawn"! He always tried to do his very best, even if the results aren't up to par. I've seen just how hard he tries. ...And yet, you refuse to even acknowledge it...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha ha! That kid is no good, y'see. No matter what he does... or is told to do!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That was my intention... from the beginning. <thought>If there was a burn mark on the Conductor's face... ...then Blaise Debeste must be hiding it. What was he wearing during the auction? That is... key to revealing the truth!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, allow me to hear your answer! Please show the piece of evidence that proves the culprit had a burn mark on his face!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Are you saying that shows the proof of the burn mark? I don't understand, y'know. I don't understand it at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste! Even if you do not understand...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I also do not understand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So this isn't the proof... There is one clear difference between the Conductor and Blaise... He should be hiding the burn mark there... Now all I need to do is present the evidence that shows it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That was my intention... from the beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you would recall Ms. Jenson's testimony. There's still one point that remains unexplained. Two types of wigs had been prepared, one of which was left unused.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do you mean the wavy wig...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was something Ms. Jenson found when she switched places with the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What does something like that have to do with the burn!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Inside the costume trunk, Ms. Jenson witnessed two wigs. One of them had been used by Ms. Jenson to make her look like the victim. Now then, just what was the other wig used for?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...It doesn't seems like it was a spare wig.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no need to overthink it. Just compare the attire of the true culprit, the Conductor, with that of Blaise Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">......! D-Don't stare at me like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you think there's just one spot where there is a huge contradiction? Specifically, around his face.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">! So that's...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Not a wig at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. ...It was no wig. Blaise Debeste! It was your fake beard!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">A... Ah ha ha... This is... a real beard, y'know. Don't tease me like that, Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Your son must have realized the truth before anyone else. That's why he was trying so desperately to protect you. You were also worried that he would tell the truth... Isn't that why you drove your son away from here? Because... he knew that his father was hiding a burn under his fake beard!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">G... Grr...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste! How about you remove that fake beard of yours!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y... YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHITBURNSITBURNSTHEGOGGLESDONOTHING!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah... A burn mark...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Justice has been served before the Goddess of Law... For that, I give you my thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I should be the one thanking you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Blaise Debeste! I hereby announce my verdict! You shall be taken into custody for the murder of Jill Crane!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... Thank you very much. I am so happy that you believed in me to the very end!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...There's no need to thank me. As a prosecutor... No, as a friend, I simply wanted to save you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I bring good tidings. It seems that former Chairman Debeste has been safely detained in the detention center. However, the search for the murder weapon, the auction gavel, continues... Blaise Debeste is a shrewd man. There is a good chance that he has already disposed of it. There is also... one piece of testimony that concerns me. Blaise Debeste mentioned that the only thing he did not fake were the letters.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">First, he found this letter in Jill Crane's clothes... Then, he also found this letter on Kay, who was unconscious in the storeroom. The contests of the letters seem to suggest that the two had been corresponding with each other... Which is why Blaise Debeste assumed that the two were working together.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ridiculous. That can't be right.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">After reading the two letters, he decided to pin the crime on Kay Faraday. In order to cast suspicion on her, he planted one of the letters in a noticeable spot... ...the deceased Jill Crane's left breast pocket.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't that just an excuse?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. That is what I thought as well. It may have simply been a last-ditch effort to save himself. However, before the stern eyes of the Goddess of Law, these are all trivial matters. His crime shall certainly not go unpunished. With this, I have finally fulfilled one of my long-standing missions.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Judge Courtney. Will you tell me what you know? Why did Blaise Debeste murder Jill Crane? And what lies hidden behind this case?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. I don't mind. You have the right to know everything. Long ago, Jill Crane was in love with a cameraman. That man was pursuing the black market auction as a journalist. And then... before he could reach the truth, he was erased.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise. ...Although in the end, she was the one who was murdered instead...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... So that's what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">While the Goddess of Law cannot condone her actions... ...we have succeeded in her goal of bringing Blaise Debeste's crimes to light.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, Judge Courtney's goal was to expose Blaise Debeste... ...and reveal the dark secrets of the P.I.C.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... By the way, what happened to the young prosecutor...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...We have been unable to contact him for some time now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Do you have any idea where he might be...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I... had not been truly working for him, so...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see... I feel very sorry for him.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...What you should be sorry for, is the fact that he was kept in the dark until now. No matter how cruel reality is, he will have to accept it. If he can't... he won't be able to walk his own path in life. ...Ever.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...A father's influence is not something that is easily erased. However, I'm sure he will be able to change from here on out.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes... That's right. Surely... You must be right. Will I too... be able to walk my own path in life...?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Kay! Is your body alright!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Yes. Thanks to you...</line>
<line speaker="Karin">I'm so sorry! Even though you're my patient... ...you ended up getting suspected because of me... Ouch! "You can't just take care of the patient's body. You gotta take care of the heart too." That's my Granny! Kay, how are your memories?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I feel like... I'm on the verge of remembering something...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That would be the trial for the murder of Horace Knightley... Who's in charge of the defense?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Crane was supposed to be her defense attorney, but now that she has passed away... ...we are currently arranging for a replacement defense attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Jill Crane had been in charge of Patricia Roland's defense!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'll also have to get in contact with Sebastian quickly, since he's the prosecutor in charge... Well then...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah...! P-Please wait! What about Mr. Edgeworth's prosecutor's badge? What will happen... to his prosecutor's badge?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">With the chairman's arrest, the P.I.C. is no longer functional... ...so I cannot answer that question easily. Perhaps one should say... Only the Goddess of Law knows?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-But that's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You don't need to worry about me. This is the path that I have chosen.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems you have no plans to change it either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course not. I chose this path to seek the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...With the departure of Blaise Debeste, the Law has once again returned to our hands. If you truly desire to continue the prosecutor's path... ...I am willing to assist you in reclaiming your badge.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I appreciate the sentiment... but I must decline. I did not relinquish my badge with half-hearted feelings.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see... It seems that our paths of Law will continues to run counter to each other.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Heh. Until our paths cross once again, I shall have you hold onto that badge.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That was my intention from the start.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.....</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...However, on occasion, the Goddess of Law is quite generous. Please return this notebook to its proper owner.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay's "Promise Notebook"!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems this was scheduled to be put up for bidding at the black market auction. The name "Kay" is written on the notebook. It seems Blaise Debeste quickly realized this belonged to the girl. Since the letters he found also contained the same name...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You speak as if he really did not know about the letters. Are you saying that Blaise really did not prepare the letters himself?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. That man said so himself... Kay Faraday's goal was to steal back the notebook. Jill Crane's goal was to get revenge. In order to achieve their goals, the two teamed up to infiltrate the auction... or so he says. </line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately... this was all Blaise's misunderstanding. It was purely a coincidence. If the attorney from the P.I.C. and Kay really were acquaintances... ...it would be strange that she never mentioned it to me, considering her personality.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ha ha. You really do trust her, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In the end, the notebook was used as another red herring, but... It's something that is very important to that girl, isn't it? I'll make a special exception and return it. I'm sure that's what the Goddess of Law desires.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's... Um.... I appreciate it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I shall pray that she recovers her lost memories.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... Is something wrong...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. I am returning something very important to you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah... This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Always greet people with a smile, even people you don't know. Never cry in front of strangers. Look, Daddy! I wrote them all down! Yup! I'll be sure to follow all of our promises, and become a hero just like you, Daddy! ...Ah! That's right! There was one more... I forgot to write down the most important promise! Promise number five... Always try your hardest to learn about things you don't understand! Eheheh... I'll be sure to remember. I'll never, ever forget them!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Always try your hardest... to learn about things you don't understand... That's right... I'm... "I" am...! I am...! ...the "Great Thief" who steals the truth, Kay Faraday! I'm the Second Yatagarasu, and Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay... You remember!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eheheh... It's kinda embarrassing, though. Thank you so much! It's all thanks to you, Mr. Edgeworth! Even when I lost my memories, you were still always trying to save me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... It seems you're back to normal.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Wow! Kay! You've gotten better! Your health comes first! Now you can relax! "Just make sure you don't run off and lose all your memories again."</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah... Ms. Jenson, Dr. Young! Thanks for worrying about me.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"Hey. If you're feeling all better, how about changing back into your own clothes?" I washed your clothes for you, Kay, so they're nice and clean!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These clothes... Wasn't Detective Gumshoe holding on to them?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">He said forensics was done with them, so he gave them back to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Have they revealed the results of the analysis yet?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Hmm... To be honest, I actually didn't think to ask about that... Now, now! More importantly, let's hurry up and get you changed, Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Still... Isn't it better if we do not remove her bandages?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Ah. She should be fine now. Kay just bumped her head. She didn't really have any other major injuries.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then... Why was she so heavily bandaged?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Better safe than sorry! A pound of prevention is worth an ounce of cure! That's my motto!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What a troublesome motto...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Karin">Come on, Kay! Let's get you dressed up over there!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Now, this is definitely what a Great Thief should look like!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...A smile certainly suits you best. In the past... and now as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. von Karma... Thank you for coming too!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I-I... I only came because Scruffy asked me to. That Scruffy, he also wanted to see your energetic self again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy...! What happened to Gummy!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Who knows... Maybe he was disgusted with the man who willingly threw away his prosecutor's badge?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>Detective Gumshoe...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...I must be going soon. I'll be taking these ladies in for questioning.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah... What's going to happen to the two of them?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">One aided in the murder of an attorney, the other forged an autopsy report 18 years ago... Those crimes definitely won't disappear. Of course... I will mention in court that they were being blackmailed by Blaise.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">We'll be just fine! As long as Granny's by my side, we're invincible!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Well then, take care.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then... Kay. Sorry to ask so soon right after you regained your memories, but I have some questions.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sure! Ask me anything you want!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What were you doing on the day you lost your memories?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">On that day... I was asked to come to Gourd Lake. I don't know who called me there, though. As I was watching the moon at Gourd Lake... ...a person in a red raincoat approached me! All of a sudden, he used some kind of drug to knock me out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...! <thought>What is she saying? The place where Kay saw the moon was at Gourd Lake?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">When I woke up, it seems I somehow ended up on the roof of the Grand Tower. My mind was still in a daze, so I stumbled around for a bit... That's when I found the person in the red raincoat, collapsed! I was startled. And when I stepped back in panic... ...I fell from a high place and got knocked out cold again! And, when I woke up, all my memories were gone. The person in the red raincoat... Who exactly was that person? Oh yeah... I was certain that I saw them walking in mid-air... Hmm... Somehow, this is all starting to make my head hurt!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Please calm down. You're just a little confused because you've only recently gotten your memory back. Most likely, this is the main cause of your confused memories...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't it because you fell in a hole?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's true, that's what caused me to lose my memories, but... ...that's not really the direct cause behind my confused memories, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm... Yes. <thought>Indeed, that's not it...</thought> Right before you were at the Grand Tower, you were at the Gourd Lake Park. In that case, there can only be one reason why your memories are confused.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? What is it then!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your name written on the Promise Notebook must be the cause.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. Why does my name being written in the Promise Notebook... ...caused me to remember the person in the red raincoat floating in mid-air?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uh... Hmm. <thought>As one would expect, they aren't related.</thought> Right before you were at the Grand Tower, you were at the Gourd Lake Park. In that case, there can only be one reason why your memories are confused.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? What is it then!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is probably the main cause of your confused memories... You saw the moon at both the Gourd Lake Park and the Grand Tower rooftop... ..which led you to confuse the two places.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? But... aren't they totally different places? Even if I was in a daze, do you really think I'd get them confused?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Most likely, there was something at the Grand Tower which led to your confusion.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wasn't this at the Grand Tower?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? That's... I'm not totally sure!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph. <thought>It seems this wasn't it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Now that you mention it, the Grand Tower rooftop... ...does kind of look similar to the Gourd Lake Park!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That must be what caused your memories to become confused.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, what specifically was the cause?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Grand Tower rooftop and Gourd Lake have two points in common. They both have a cherry tree and a food stall.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Now that you mention it...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your memories were confused because you had been in two similar locations. The person that you first saw could not have been walking in mid-air. They were simply walking on the ground at Gourd Lake Park. You must have gotten that scene confused with the Grand Tower rooftop.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">S-So that's what happened... How dare they steal the memories of a Great Thief! They'll pay for this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nevertheless... I wonder who the person that assaulted Kay was? The person in the red raincoat, who appeared at Gourd Lake...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm. What's that noise?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sounds like it's coming from the storeroom! Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go check it out!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Wh-What's this!? My shutterbug sense is tinglin'! I smell me another scoop!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>! Y-You're still here...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! This walkie-talkie thing here is what's beeping!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm...! <thought>This transceiver... Why do I feel like I've seen it somewhere before...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-It's still beeping, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm not particularly familiar with this sort of evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">C'mon, we have to answer it! Here goes!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hello! Edgeworth speaking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">K-Kay. Please don't just answer it on your own.</line>
<line speaker="???">I am speaking with Mr. Miles Edgeworth, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Th-This voice is...!</thought> ...Shelly de Killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You...! Why do you know about the incident!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I've had an inkling that such a person existed, even before you said anything. After all, there was evidence to suggest that someone had used Kay to disrupt the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? There was...? So... who's this mastermind?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This indicates the existence of a mastermind in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm, I can't say I really understand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh... <thought>So this wasn't it? Wasn't there anything that was left unexplained among the evidence?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was the letter that Kay allegedly sent to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">C-Come to think of it...! I don't remember writing that letter at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're not the one who wrote the letter?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This man... How does he know that!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">He said the case wasn't solved yet. What did he mean by that? And why would Mr. de Killer even bother telling us that? Ugh... Nothing makes sense anymore!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This case... has not reached its true conclusion yet. However... although I've lost my prosecutor's badge, who I am still has not changed. While I don't know where this may lead me, I shall reveal the truth... I swear it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a clear contradiction in your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">In that case, would you care to explain what the contradiction is? Depending on your answer, you may or may not incur the wrath of my whip.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwaaah! <thought>I didn't even say anything yet!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">As long as she has her whip, words alone won't reach her! You'll need to present evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. I won't let her whip me again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Doesn't your testimony contradict with this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You would do well to think things over yourself before questioning others. And for the record, my answer is "nein"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>I guess that was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">What are you doing, Miles? You're turning Franny-pie into fifty shades of rage! Before that whip hits you, you should hurry up and... YOOOWZAAA!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Foolish words will only result in fifty shades of pain!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should settle this before Mr. Shields ends up as fifty shades of maimed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, will you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth. I'm warning you, if you do not wish to become my whip's next victim... Do not present such meaningless things before me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! <thought>What was the point of warning me!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth, scientifically speaking, that whip looks extremely painful!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't need science to tell me how painful it is...</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Maybe you should be a bit more careful next time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Should I have a problem with it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhooh! <thought>I don't think that left a good impression...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. There is a contradiction in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I cannot authorize this statement.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... And why not?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Because it's obvious you're bluffing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nguuuoooh! <thought>Is that the impression I give off? ...Next time for sure, I will present evidence that will silence her for good!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Doesn't this piece of evidence create a contradiction in your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hrmmm... I wonder. What do you think, Sebastian?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I don't really understand, but I don't think so.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I know, right? That's what I was thinking as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ugh! <thought>What's with this father and son tag team...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, it's fine. Why don't we just give up...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. It's still much too early to give up. I will definitely prove your innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste! Take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What's wrong, Edgeworth? You're getting all fired up. Maybe you should cool your head and think it over once again. 'Cause I don't have time to put up with something as meaningless as that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So that was wrong!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Mr. Edgeworth. You really think someone like you can defeat my pops!? Pops is super important, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yes, yes. You're embarrassing me, Sebastian, so please stop, OK?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blaise Debeste... He seems to be a fairly formidable opponent. I should make my moves more carefully.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste. Take a look at this piece of evidence and tell me what you think!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What do I think? Absolutely nothing at all... Right, Sebastian?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Yeah, Pops. That has nothing to do with your testimony just now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>Even Sebastian...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like Mr. Debeste has gotten a bit livelier, hasn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. He probably feels a lot more confident with his father backing him up. However, I will break through that confidence of the Debeste father and son duo.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dr. Young! Your testimony is wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Granny is pretty old, so you should treat her more nicely... Ouch! "Don't treat me like I'm old! I'm not so senile that I would be tricked by a bluff like that."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>That wasn't a bluff.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Granny is a lively one, isn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Although I feel like she is a bit too lively... Let's see if we can quiet her down.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Mr. Edgeworth, please be nice to the elderly, okay?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Jenson. I would like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">Errm, me? "I'm the one giving testimony now. Why are you asking my granddaughter?"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>It's because you two are tied to the hip, that's why I got mixed up! There might be something I failed to hear. Let me try listening carefully to "Dr. Young's" words one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dr. Young. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"I don't mind looking, but just what is that?" Yeah! Just what is that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. It doesn't really matter if you don't understand.</line>
<line speaker="Karin">"If it doesn't matter, then you shouldn't have shown it to me from the start."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>She is quite right... She is quite a feisty old lady... However, I won't be defeated in a place like this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I've had enough of yer time wastin' shenanigans! You'd best skedaddle now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sh-Shoot... I messed up!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know... I'm a pretty busy man. I'll be heading back now, y'see?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sh-Shoot... I messed up!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing of interest here.</line>
