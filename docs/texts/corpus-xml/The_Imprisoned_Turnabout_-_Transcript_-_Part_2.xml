<title>The Imprisoned Turnabout</title>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did you not mention that beforehand?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No! ...But I did! Um... What didn't I mention?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That you're a member of the Berry Big Circus.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No! It's just that, you know! I'm not! I can't call myself a member yet. I'm just a new recruit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regardless, that still makes you a member!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Eek!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So why didn't you tell us that before?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">If I had told you I was part of the circus, it would've made me look suspicious, right?! Since I also knew Knightley and all that. I didn't think anyone would believe what I had to say... Not even you guys, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't we promise to believe in you?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">But M-Mr. Edgeworth! You're just... kinda scary...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Man, you're just terrible at getting info from people. Aren't cha, Miles?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Hmph. That's none of your concern. Looks like we need to have a talk with him again...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, um, what did you do in the circus, Simon?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I guess you could say I'm a wild animal tamer. I'm still just an apprentice though...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow, that's incredible! So you command lions and tigers to do your bidding, right?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nuh-uh! Nothing crazy like that! Nowaynowaynowaynoway! My partner is this little guy right here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...And that makes you a wild animal tamer?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">He's more like an organ grinder than a wild animal tamer... He he he.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hey, Money! Cut that out! He can be quite a handful sometimes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought organ grinders controlled their monkeys, not the other way around...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yesterday, you told us you were just a regular employee, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">E-Even if I'm a member of the circus, I'm still legally an employee... We're just like any regular company. The ringleader is the boss and I'm just a grunt. I even have a supervisor... She's the head of the Wild Animal Tamer Division. No matter what kind of fierce creature, they all immediately follow her every command.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. She might even be able to get a handle on Miles here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I am not a wild animal.</thought> Did you and your supervisor take part in the Animal Show here at the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yeah, it was just us two. It was only a small operation this time around. Basically, my supervisor takes center stage and I take care of all the dirty work. Well, I did have a tiny part in the performance...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So there are only two members of the circus that are related to this case.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, can you tell me about your movements around the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">OK. I went to meet Knightley two days ago around noon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that's when you gave him the chessboard?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's right. And then that night, I started setting up the stage in the courtyard. It was pretty tough going back and forth moving all the crates by myself... I left everything in... Workroom A, I think. Just temporary storage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Workroom A... That's where the body was discovered.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Didn't your supervisor help you at all?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No way! I can't let her do anything like that! That's my job. After I got everything ready, we started rehearsing. When we left, it was almost midnight. The show was set to start at 8 AM the next day and go on until 10 AM.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The only one who went in and out of where the body was found is Mr. Keyes... And then the body was found just before the show ended.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Wh-What is that? Is that a Cerberus carving?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not quite, but you're not far off.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I-It's impossible! Even if I'm an animal tamer... ...I only just started recently, there's no way I could tame such a beast... Absolutely nowaynowaynoway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>How does he see this tiny chess piece in such a fashion...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Knightley told me it was real tough on him not being able to play chess... ...so when he found someone to play with, he seemed really happy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this memo contains a record of moves for a correspondence chess game. <thought>As someone who is also fond of the game, he had an admirable enthusiasm.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you happen to know why you were arrested?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's weird how it happened so fast. I don't think that DaPest guy would just have you arrested on a whim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wouldn't put it past him though...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well, maybe it's because... of that. When I was moving the crates, I decided to go check up on him. You know, Knightley...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-You went directly into the detention block? Did you have permission?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No... I had to sneak in. It wasn't a formal visit or anything...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't you already see him two days ago? Why would you go and do such a thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families. I just wanted to talk with him for a bit, so I went to see him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hm? You didn't have a family?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Um... When I was younger, I lost the only family I had, my father...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So is that it? I know all too well how it feels to lose your father at a young age...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So you're the same as Mr. Edgeworth and me...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So it was just the two of you talking at that time?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yes. All the other cells were empty and there weren't any guards nearby either.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he, but then you got found out, and that's why they suspected you.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What!? What!? Did I do something really bad?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something must have happened while Mr. Keyes and Knightley were alone... That's probably Debeste's logic.</thought> It seems that we'll need to talk with your supervisor as well.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">She should be here today, too. Probably in the courtyard. Ooh... I'm sorry it turned out like this, Boss...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon! If there's anything we can to do help, just tell us!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What? What? B-But, I can't do anything in return...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.</thought> We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, what do we have here? Starting to get a hang of the whole defense attorney gig? You sounded a bit like your old man just now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Hm. Me... Sound like my father?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. He would say, "The defense attorney's job is to be an ally to the deserted." If you're going to ride that stallion into the sunrise, wait for me, I want in too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields... I think you mean "sunset".</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Yeah, of course. It was just a joke! Want some candy?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">N-No, thank you. I don't like sweets.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh, really? What a shame.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What's wrong with the sunrise? The legendary Yatagarasu is all about the sun! Since the sunlight always exposes the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Good grief...</thought> For now, let's just head to the prison courtyard and see what we can find there.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! The shutter is open!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It looks like that way leads to the courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So what are we waitin' for? C'mon, let's get a move on!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph... She's certainly in high spirits.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So this is the courtyard...</thought> Just before the body was discovered, the Animal Show was held here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks just like a carnival! Man, I bet it was lots of fun!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The prisoners were gathered here when the body was found. So that means whoever saw the show has an alibi...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We should start by checking the area for...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">C-C-Cut it out, you! Help me, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-You there! Stop right this instant!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ow ow ow ow ow! Someone, anyone! Help!</line>
<line speaker="???">Down! Astique! Down!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-Who are...?</line>
<line speaker="???">Looks like you found a new playmate. Good for you, Astique!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It wasn't playing around! It was about to eat me!</line>
<line speaker="???">Huh? No way, that's impossible. This child doesn't bite. ...Often.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Often, huh?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">People normally never get to play with an elephant up close. Isn't it wonderful?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No, it's not!</line>
<line speaker="???">It's wonderful... right?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It was simply marvelous, little lady.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>M-Mr. Shields...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Really?! Oh, that makes me so happy!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So how about a hug... as thanks? Hey! Watch where you swing that thing! Weren't you taught not to hit people with your trunk?</line>
<line speaker="???">Ha ha ha! It looks like Astique is friends with everyone!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am... an assistant of this defense attorney. My name is Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! I haven't introduced myself yet! I'm Regina Berry! Nice to meet ya!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm the Great Thief and defense attorney's assistant's assistant, Kay Faraday!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's a rather complicated job title...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">And the one playing with Mr. Elephant is the defense attorney, Mr. Ray Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">It's not "Mr. Elephant". It's Astique, the fantastic Asian elephant!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're incredible, Regina! You made Astique stop right already!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Well, I'm a wild animal tamer, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really!? Then, you must be Simon's supervisor...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yep! I'm the head of the Berry Big Circus Wild Animal Tamer Division. The one and only Regina Berry!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm ace attorney, Ray Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...It looks like he's the one she has a handle on.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">......Hmmm. Yes, she's perfect!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What are you mumbling about, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Look at her! She's energetic, fun-loving and healthy! She could be the new member of the Yatagarasu... She'd be perfect as a Great Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">...A Great Thief? That sounds like fun! We could make a huge ruckus with the animals!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! You can't make a ruckus! A Great Thief is supposed to be quiet and sneaky-like...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">But the show needs to have flash! Being quiet is... kinda boring.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww. I guess she's not very thief-like after all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...It seems there has been a breakdown in negotiations.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright, let's get started, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's check out anything that looks suspicious! We'll even look through the barbed wire if we have to.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, we need to gather more information about the case. We should also try talking with anyone connected to the case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Man! It's such a shame!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What is?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I should have joined the circus! I just know my amazing rope escapes would have received standing ovations!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's a shame indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">All that's left for me now, is to solve this case... And take part in their next show! Come on! Let's hurry and finish collecting information!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">R-Right.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Being an animal groomer seems kinda fun. Ah, Mr. Edgeworth. Could I interest you in a mud pack facial?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Absolutely not.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's no need to hold back. See? We've got a rubber glove right here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Stop playing around with the evidence! ...Hm? <thought>The mud on this rubber glove...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh, is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Are you really mad at me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. Kay. You've done some fine work.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh? Uh, Ah... I know, right? Eheheh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Looks like I'll need to have a talk with Mr. Sahwit...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Can metal detectors detect all types of metals?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A high-end model should be able to. However, there are certain metals that may be difficult to detect.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ho ho, such as?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Objects without a magnetic field seem to be harder to detect.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see, I see! As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I've learned a lot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I probably shouldn't be teaching this kind of stuff to a Great Thief...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">"DANGER! High Voltage"! These signs really do exist! On the other side, you can see what appears to be the detention center's garden!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's just as Warden Roland said, you can see the garden from her office.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it weren't for this barbed wire, we could take a look at the garden on the other side!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is Warden Roland's prized garden, I doubt she'd let us in so easily.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">*rrribbit!*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What are you doing?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't you know? If you croak like a frog at a pond, they will come towards you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...The only things that are coming towards you are the water striders.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Water striders are so cool! They're like ninjas! They glide gracefully on top of the water...! I wish I could do that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What about the frogs?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the Berry Big Circus's Asian elephant, Astique. Supposedly, very friendly with humans...</line>
<line speaker="Astique">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Doesn't seem very friendly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's your stern gaze, Mr. Edgeworth. It must think you're the boss.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Are you comparing me to an animal?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's not what I meant. Umm... I think it approves of you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That doesn't make me the least bit happy.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hm? What's the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">This is nice. It feels like a dream.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A circus performance can be considered an art form.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">My pounding heart. It's beating with excitement.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's not everyday you get to see what goes on inside a circus tent.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Exactly. It sure makes me want to give it a big hug.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hug... The circus?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Having an Animal Show inside a place surrounded by barbed wire. It almost makes you forget that this is a prison facility.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Barbed wire, huh... I'll need to inspect every last inch of this prison.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">We didn't see the Animal Show, but the stage and the equipment are still here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should examine the remnants of the show. It could be useful to our investigation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Miles. Please don't ignore your Uncle Ray like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray's feeling faint! I've never seen such dreamy eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She... does seem to have an enchanting presence.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Exactly. I feel like I must obey her! I wonder if she cracks a whip when she's taming her animals. With those sparkling eyes she'll say, "Down boy!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If that's what you're after, I have someone in mind...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ehh! You know someone like that! You must introduce me, Miles!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She's the whip carrying demon from the prosecutor's bench...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a wicker crate... No, there are tires attached to it, so I guess it's a cart.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">*sniff* *sniff*... It kinda smells like animals.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They probably use this instead of a hand trolley at the circus.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Just once, I'd like to ride one of these bad boys down a hill.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Or maybe one of those office chairs with wheels, doesn't that sound like fun?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What... is she talking about?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That door is locked.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Want me to pick the lock? Success is not guaranteed though!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, if need be I'll just borrow a key.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sheesh. I thought it was finally a chance for me to steal the spotlight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't even think about stealing anything in my presence... Not even the spotlight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Head of the Wild Animal Tamer Division... Are you Mr. Keyes' supervisor?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">That's right. Berry Big Circus was created by my Daddy. But Daddy died in a murder incident...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Your... Dad is...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">But. After that... our current Ringmaster made the circus even bigger. The Ringmaster is Daddy's close friend. He's like a funny uncle.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! A funny uncle... That's great, Regina!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yup. Uncle Moe established the Wild Animal Tamer, Magic, and Ventriloquist Divisions. Only the Wild Animal Tamer and Ventriloquist Divisions have subordinates though. Berry Big Circus is going to become even more fabulous!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes, yes! That sounds amazing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The way these two are carrying on... I'd hate to put a damper on things.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell us about the Animal Show?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">It's an amazing show! It has a storyline and everything. What's more... It's a love story. Doesn't that sound wonderful?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Very nice. Are you the heroine, Regina-pie?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Nope, The heroine of this show is Astique! And her partner is Regent the tiger! It's about the forbidden love between an elephant and a tiger!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">E-Elephant and tiger? ...Forbidden love?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">That's right! It's what they call a love triangle! Isn't it romantic?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sounds amazing. Right, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Heroine... Astique is a female elephant?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Umm. Since it's a love triangle, shouldn't there be one more animal involved?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yup. The third animal. He's the one who interferes with the love between Astique and Regent.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. What do you think it is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well. Since it's a circus... Perhaps a lion?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I think a crow would be nice.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">He he he. The third animal is a naughty little monkey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The scale suddenly got smaller.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Money the monkey!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Nope. The one who plays the role of the monkey is Simon. Money is a little too small. He's like the villain who tries to break up the love between Astique and Regent! How will Astique and Regent control their own destiny!? ...Isn't it wonderful?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I... I guess.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I thought Mr. Keyes just did all the grunt work.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Wouldn't you feel sorry for Simon if he didn't get to perform on stage?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell me about the preparations for the show?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon handled everything... So I don't know that much about it. Simon insisted on it. He wanted me to focus on the show. I saw Simon doing something near the well though...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The well... If I recall, it was behind the stage... I'd better go take a look at it later...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">He even moved this giant cage all by himself. Simon is such a nice guy!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-That... sounds like something Simon would do.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>While crying profusely.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">During the preparations, Simon went back and forth between the workroom and the courtyard. We were using the workroom to store our equipment. Only Simon entered that room, so I don't know anything about it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The workroom... Was it the one where we found the dead body? So, Simon was the only one who entered workroom A?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Man. The bad news just keeps on coming.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Mr. Lawyer, please promise me you'll help Simon.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't worry! Despite his looks, Mr. Edgeworth is really amazing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Despite my looks... And just what is wrong with the way I look?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Umm... OK. I'll accept it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">? Hold it. Did I say anything about giving it to you?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">You're not giving it to me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course not.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">.........................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I'm sorry. It's my fault for presenting it to you.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">It's alright. I forgive you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Urk... Why am I apologizing to her!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Wow, what a cute doggy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C-Cute... doggy?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yup! Ah, but this child... Won't play nice with others. From the look in his eyes, he only opens his heart to his master. I'm certain he's a good doggy though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh...? You can tell that much just by looking at a picture?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Of course! I'm the Head Animal Tamer, after all! Ah, Mr. Edgeworth also has the same eyes as that doggy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...! <thought>My heart isn't closed off!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! Is this a present? Yay! I'm so happy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, that was not my intention...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">I'm sorry. Unless it's an animal, I can't tame it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That was also not my intention.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the stage where they put on the Animal Show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If I put on a Great Thief Show, I wonder if anyone would come?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm pretty sure the police would show up...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This crude-looking well seems handcrafted. Was it built by the inmates?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There are a bunch of tools lying around the well... A long piece of rope... And a heavy-looking weight! It weighs... 33 pounds. It says so right there! There's even a couple of pulleys!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Please stop touching other people's things.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Stingy pants! I'm just checking stuff out, it's not like I'm going to take them home with me...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Still, these tools... What were they used for?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Ah, Mr. Attorney. How are we doing today?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We're doing... hey! We just met a few moments ago!</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Please do forgive me. Ever since I've come here, I've been working on refining my speech.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not the only thing that needs refining.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Right now, I'm helping out with the cleanup after the show. Ahh. But if there's anything you need, please let me know. You'll have my full cooperation.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">I'm in the middle of volunteer work right now. As you can see, I am a model prisoner. I have been reborn inside this prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Reborn, as a thief.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Th-That was... The devil made me do it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">How can you blame the devil? You're a disgrace to thieves!</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">I have nothing to say. I still have much to learn.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...As a thief?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">But, as you can see, I've exchanged my bracelet for a working one... I will continue to devote myself to being a model prisoner.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Again with the "model prisoner". Give it a rest already...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">I'm training to pay my debt to society, once I become eligible for parole.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So you were training instead of watching the Animal Show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So there were only two people who did not watch the show, Sahwit and Dogen.</thought> Why didn't you say anything about Dogen earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Well... if you asked any inmate at this prison, they'd all think twice before telling you. That person is like the ruler of this place. Around here... we call him the Supplier.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...The Supplier?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">If you ask him nicely, he can provide you with anything you want.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What! Is that allowed?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Normally, it's not allowed. But with him, it's another story. He supposedly has a secret route to procure these goods...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>As the Supplier, Dogen would be in a position of power.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">However, I've put all that behind me. All I care about now is applying mud packs to the animals.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mud packs?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">I coat the animal's fur with my mineral-rich mud packs to give it a beautiful shine. To help with my training, I give them to all the animals in prison. Each and every one of them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mud... huh. It could be related to that piece of evidence. I should present it to him...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">My, my, what a lovely badge. I see that you have some class, unlike some two-bit attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you referring to the attorney who put you in here?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Yes, yes! That's right! That shyster, the next time I see him I'm going to bust his kneecaps! Oh! ...Figuratively speaking.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't know who he's talking about... But he seems to be holding quite a grudge.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">! That's the rubber glove I dropped.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Where did the mud on this glove come from?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Ahh. That's the mud from my mud packs. At the time I was practicing applying my mud packs.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell me when this took place on the day of the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Since the Animal Show had started... I'd say it was around 9 AM. The mud packs turned the animals' bodies pitch black! And my heart was pure white...! I was totally engrossed with covering the animals in mud!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Prison life must be taxing on his stress levels...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Thanks to the warden's policies, I can undergo job training here... I owe her a debt of gratitude.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">It's because of these sensors that the inmates cannot come and go as they please.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Except for you.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">I-Is that right? B-But I didn't do anything wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have been acting rather suspiciously though.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">P-Please don't lose your hair over it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you mean, "lose your head"? <thought>It's easy to see he's upset.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Please have a look. As you can see, I've exchanged my bracelet. And it's all thanks to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good for you.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">It's really all because of you... No, no, it's all thanks to you. I truly mean it, this bracelet, it was all your doing. I had to get this exchanged. All thanks to you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He still seems pretty angry. Not the least bit repentant.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">A place to hide the murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Do you have any ideas?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">I don't think an inmate would be able to hide anything inside the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">................</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">H-Hey! Why do you keep looking at my hair!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ahh, no. Sorry. Never mind. <thought>I've already seen first hand that he isn't hiding anything under that hairpiece.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">That has nothing to do with me, so I know nothing about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you sure about that? I think you know more than you're letting on.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Preposterous! From head to toe... There is not a single thing about me that is a lie. Because I am a model prisoner.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The hair on his head is a lie... But it's probably better if I didn't say anything about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These were used for audience seating during the show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Folding up all these chairs must have been a chore.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that so?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't tell me, you've never tidied up folding chairs before?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've delegated the task to others in the past...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... You should try doing some manual labor once in awhile.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I'll look into it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's covered in mud, up to the wrist. It must have come from the animals' mud packs.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh my~! There you are, Regina-darling!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah, Ms. Roland!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I was looking all over for you! I wanted to have a little chat with you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell me a little about this prison?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Currently, this place is my pride and joy, which I like to call our Home... When I first came here, this prison was in a terrible state.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Terrible state... You mean the prisoners' attitudes?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">There are no bad children in my family! It was the environment that was terrible! That's why, after giving it a lot of thought, I enlisted the help of the animals.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Being together with animals will soften up even the most hardened criminals.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Right now, everyone has returned to their most honest self. Just take a look at Franky! He's a model prisoner.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A model prisoner who was trying to steal from a dead body...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">There are lots of model prisoners here... but Franky is number one! He's proactive with his job training and helps out with the chores...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't the other model prisoners do job training and chores?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Eh? Uh hu hu, don't be silly? They all do, of course. I-It's just that Franky here... He has his sights set on something different.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? Something feels strange...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">In any case, he's a very good boy! Please get along with one another!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">The enchanting music! The prancing animals! The Berry Big Circus is fabulous! Hu hu hu. If you come here you can see a show once a month.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really? Then maybe I should...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was she just thinking about committing a crime?</thought> "Once a month," you said. Is it always the Berry Big Circus?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Of course! I'm Regina-darling's biggest fan! My darling Regina... She's just, so fabulous. She's such a cutie pie, I could just eat her up!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">She really likes her darling Regina.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...That's why I'm worried. About poor little Simon. If he is found guilty, Regina-darling will be heartbroken. Mr. Lawyer, please take care of little Simon. If there's anything I can help with, please don't hesitate to ask.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">So you're the one who brings me my new family members!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Family members...?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Thanks to you our home has become much more lively! Please bring us 100 more, or even 1000 more people! I just love lively places!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose you'll be bringing in the same number of animals too.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">But of course!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It wouldn't be a stretch to say that this place would become the world's biggest zoo...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">...He never got the chance to become a part of our family... No matter how many times I called out for him, he would not respond. He was just a nice little boy who loved chess. ...It's such a shame.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">................ <thought>She's in her own little world.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">This facility is filled with my love! Once you step inside, you won't be able to leave... You'll form iron bonds!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're saying that the security here is flawless?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Come now! Would you please stop using such crude words like security? Chains of love! It's the bonds that bind them!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She thinks everything's alright because of her tight bonds...? ...What about Sahwit's broken bracelet?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm. <thought>Her expression changed...?</thought> Could you tell me about this "family member".</line>
<line speaker="Roland">You're mistaken. Those outside of my circle of love are not called "family members".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I see. <thought>So, there are things that are outside of her control.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were in charge of the investigation inside the prison, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That's right! Everyone helped out and we split up the investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Everyone? You don't mean the animals?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Of course! They were all happy to help!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I heard that in the end, you didn't find anything...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That's right. Everyone did their best though...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Splitting up the investigation with the animals... That doesn't seem very reliable.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to hear your thoughts about this...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Hu hu hu! Very well! Come here, you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">L-Let go of my hand! That's not what I wanted you to look at.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh my, I'm sorry. How thoughtless of me! A proper greeting should begin with a hug and a kiss!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-This isn't a joke!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">But, really! I would have loved to show everyone yesterday! You did a wonderful job on the stage, Regina-darling!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">*giggle* I'm so happy to hear that! I'm glad all the prisoners came to see it!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well, about that... Just between you and me, not everyone came to see the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That would be Dogen and Sahwit, I imagine...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">There were 3 people who didn't see your show yesterday. Unbelievable, really.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me, but did you say there were three prisoners who did not see the show?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That's right. I took a count and there were three empty seats. And we even had the correct number of seats set out...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Doesn't that seem weird to you, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It does. We had thought that Dogen and Sahwit were the only two prisoners... ...who were not present in the courtyard during the show. ...But that doesn't add up. Where did the third person go...? Further investigation is needed.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Ah, I was having so much fun talking to you, Regina-darling, that I completely forgot! It's time to feed my baby!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>..."My baby"?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! It's an a-a-a-alligator!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh, Ally! You look as cute as ever!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Oh, how cute! So her name is Ally?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yup! She's Ally the alligator! She's my favorite out of all my family!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">How lovely. I wanna try petting it!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">If Regina-darling wants to pet it, go right ahead, I'll allow it!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Th-They seem pretty excited...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">W-We need to go check the prison cells, don't we?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's right. Let's look for the third prisoner who didn't see the Animal Show.</line>
<line speaker="???">M-Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. I take it the investigation is running smoothly?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The judge and that prosecutor haven't shown up yet! Oh, yeah! I also got your message, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was the result of the examination of the victim's cell?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">We hit the jackpot, sir! Traces of blood were found on the cell floor! There wasn't a whole lot there though...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This should prove that the murder occurred in the holding cell!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. The probability has increased. However, we still cannot say for certain.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I thought you'd say that, sir, so I asked the lab guys to look into it a little further. They're running an analysis on the blood so we'll know soon if it's the victim's or not!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Way to go, Gummy! Good thinking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective... You've outdone yourself. What caused this sudden foresight?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'm actually a little hurt that you're so surprised by it, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I hope nothing bad comes of this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Once we get the results, we can prove that the scene was the holding cell. Which leaves...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...finding out how that doggy managed to sneak his way in here!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Just leave that to me, pal! Since that other prosecutor isn't here, we can investigate as much as we want! That's why I brought my secret weapons with me!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Secret weapons?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's right, pal! They've gotten us out of a few jams before... Take a gander at Dick Gumshoe's Seven Secret Weapons!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Looks like he'll come in handy. Want to take up his offer, Miles?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, please allow us the use of your "secret weapons".</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sure thing, sir! First, I'll give you a rundown! Secret Weapon No. 1: The trusty metal detector! Perfect for finding all kinds of metallic objects!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>As its name implies.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Next, Secret Weapon No. 2: Everyone's favorite pal, Missile! He can track any scent you want, especially the scent of food!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He's much cuter than Mr. Dogen's dog!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">And then, Secret Weapon No. 3: It's umm... this!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Isn't that a fishing pole? What are you trying to catch?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No! Actually, I just brought it by accident...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Never mind that. What's next, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Umm, that's all of them, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? You called them the "Seven Secret Weapons", but there's only three of them!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's all I have for now, pal! We can use the rest next time. I can't just reveal them all at once! Why do you think they're called "secret weapons," pal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It doesn't matter. We'll just use the three that he's provided.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Alright! Which one do you want to use?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The metal detector, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The metal detector, sir? I'll sweep the area right away! Metal detector, activate!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What happened, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sorry about that, sir... It seems the battery's dead.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww man... Guess we can't use that then.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Looks like the metal detector won't be any help to us. Try another one, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The fishing pole, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The fishing pole, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a pond in the prison courtyard... Something important may have fallen in.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Roger that, sir! I'll fish it out right away!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Whoaaaaah, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's the matter, Detective Gumshoe?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It got away, sir... I thought I hooked something big, but the line snapped! There has to be a monster fish in there, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's likely that alligator... I won't tell him that though.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I guess the fishing pole won't be of any more use to us. Try another one, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You want Missile, sir? Hey, pal! Over here, Missile!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! There he is!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">First, let's decide what scent he should track down!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We are searching for the route Dogen's dog used to get to the detention cell. This route would have also been the same path used to carry the body to the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So if we have him track the scent of the body...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...that should lead us to the path!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hm? Don't you smell something sweet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Really? All I can smell is the scent of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's a very faint scent. Like cake or something.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The scent of cake from the body?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Alright, Missile. Get a good whiff of that scent, pal! C'mon, let's follow after him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That way is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">H-He's heading towards the special cell.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And he's gone straight inside!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Let's follow him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is Dogen's cell, but it looks like he's absent at the moment. ...Maybe he's being interrogated?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What's in here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Shhhhh! I think he's found something!</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Grrr! Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What could there be in this room?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, we better take a look!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A teacup and biscuits... I suppose he has his tea time in here, too.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Playing chess while drinking tea in his cell... Isn't this going a bit overboard with the "special treatment"? It's like he gets whatever he wants!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't complain to me. ...You should tell him yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-I think I'll pass on that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's Dogen's chessboard. It still has that hound piece on it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, the chessboard has legs! Aren't these things expensive?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They can be. <thought>This is very good craftsmanship.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Dogen playing chess is kinda unexpected, y'know? I figured he'd be more of a Go player or something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Go... Do you play Go, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm really good at Gobang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...But, that's not Go.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! There's a small chisel here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not well-versed in woodworking, but this seems to be a pocket-sized chisel.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A pocket-sized chisel! It must be convenient to have one wherever you go!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that... from a thief's point of view?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No, it's from a Great Thief's point of view!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...She didn't even skip a beat.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the chisels Dogen uses. <thought>More than enough for him to murder someone with.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Speaking of chisels... It kind of looks like someone used a chisel on your forehead, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And what is that supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">See? That furrow between your brow is getting deeper! It looks just like a carving!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I would leave the subject alone if I were you.</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Hm? Missile, maybe... This is what you're barking at?</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Whoa, hey! Knock it off, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Chocolate cake is bad for dogs! If that's how it's gonna be, I'll eat it all myself! ...Wow, that was pretty good!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he, good for you! But it looks like someone else has a problem with that...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That wasn't fair, Gummy! I wanted to eat it, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I doubt it's wise to eat food you find lying around a prison.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Anyway, I guess Missile was barking at the cake, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was pointless...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Is that police dog going to get the job done?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">H-He's fine, pal! He was just following his stomach instead of his nose. Let's track down the scent of the body for real this time, Missile!</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ooh! Looks like he's found something else, sir! Now it's this cell!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This would be Mr. Elbird's cell. I'd like to examine the interior. Detective, call a guard.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Roger that, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good work Detective. By the way... Is Jay Elbird still being held in the disciplinary room?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">No... He should've already returned. He was present during the noon roll call... He may have been assigned to work some place else.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. Well then... May we examine the cell?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, how many minutes do you think this hourglass foes for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Elbird is a former boxer... So I'd say three minutes. In a boxing match, each round lasts for three minutes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Bzzzzzt! Wrong! The correct answer is "Around two minutes"! Why? Well, because the glass is cracked and some sand has spilled out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...! <thought>How could I have missed that!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! There's a poster of Mr. Elbird on the wall! And what's this next to it... Is this his weight loss target?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... He was a former boxer. He probably continued with his weight management. It seems he also takes various protein supplements.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Muscle Protein", "Hustle Protein"... "Weight Loss Protein" ...Nothing but protein.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which weight class was he aiming for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Rocky" is written here in messy handwriting. Could this be the bear's toy? This prisoner... seems very close to his unusual partner.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, this takes me back! Didn't you play with stuff like this when you were a kid?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... I don't recall doing that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...... Well then, what did you play when you were younger?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Chess, golf... and the flute, things like that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">......Mr. Edgeworth. Didn't you have ANY friends?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-Why must you be so concerned about that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Giving the prisoners a heater is careless. They're much too lenient here...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Did this guy use the heater every day?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was probably for his weight management, since training was his hobby.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wouldn't his partner, Rocky, get too hot...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think their combination is hot enough.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This sandbag shows signs of repeated use...</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aha ha! You wanna box too, Missile?</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ha ha ha. Look at him go...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It can't be... Detective, move this sandbag at once!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y... Yes sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...A hole? This is...</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey! Missile! Come back here!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm going too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'll stop them, sir! Uuugh... It's too tight for me, siiiir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">D-Detective... ........ It can't be helped. I'll have to wait for her to contact me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......... Hello! Kay! Are you alright?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't get so worked up! Right now I'm in the detention center!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The detention center?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That hole comes out at Knightley's cell!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Really!? Stay where you are. I'm coming over there now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! He he he. I really helped out, didn't I?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. <thought>She doesn't appear to be injured.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The floorboards have been ripped out from under the bed, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... It seems we've found what we were looking for. The passageway between the detention center and prison is blocked by solid doors. However, there was a secret underground tunnel beneath it. We were following a sweet scent and arrived here. That means... ...the scent must have come from Knightley's body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Come to think of it... His body was covered in dirt. It may have been caused by passing through the tunnel. Kay! What was the inside of tunnel like?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It was pitch black, so I really couldn't see much but... ...I took some photos!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please show us. <thought>...Mmph. This is!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Spoons and forks... Were these used to dig the tunnel? But, more importantly... What are these footprints?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These footprints... Could they belong to a dog?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This will surely be vital evidence. However, before we consider that, we have a big problem...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">A problem?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Jay Elbird could use this tunnel to move around freely. Detective! Confirm his whereabouts posthaste! Perhaps he's...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-You may be right... sir! This is a big deal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After speaking with the guards, the search for Jay Elbird was carried out immediately. They searched every nook and cranny of the detention center and the prison... But in the end, they found no sign of him...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Did you contact the police?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Yes, ma'am! We've already done that! We've set up a security perimeter around the prison, ma'am!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Right... This is the first scandal in our prison's history...</line>
<line speaker="Guard">We're so sorry!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She's completely different from before.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Mr. Edgeworth, was it? Thank you for finding the escapee's tunnel. But, it's a little too late... Mr. Elbird has long since left here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't believe he has gone beyond the detention center. There are security gates located at the exit of the detention center. I  believe it would have been difficult to get through those, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Maybe he has another tunnel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We certainly can't deny that possibility, however...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Anyway, there's no use in you being here now. Please return to your investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, we'll do that.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">You guys get back to your posts too!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Yes, ma'am!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Detective Gumshoe, sir! We've got the results of that blood test you requested!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Good work, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These are the forensic results on the bloodstain found in Knightley's cell.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, what's it say? Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The blood is confirmed to have been Knightley's.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Hey now, that's good news! We've found the bloodstain in Knightley's cell and discovered the tunnel the dog used... Furthermore, the security camera shows footage of a dog attacking Knightley in his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We have all the evidence we need. It's time we asked Dogen a few questions.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Dogen... did you say? Please, use utmost caution. That man even has henchmen outside of the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Outside of the prison... Is this related to his secret trade routes as the "Supplier"?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">The police have been searching for Dogen's henchmen for ages. I've also been helping them, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So that means, back then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Guard">So, he still won't talk? Even after all the trouble you went through to get the evidence transferred from the precinct...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That's right. I don't know how many times I've tried. I can't report back empty handed...</line>
<line speaker="Guard">That assassin sure is one tough cookie, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You had evidence transferred from the precinct...?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes. We borrowed all the evidence concerning Dogen. I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But... ...no matter how much evidence we have on him, we can't get a single word out of him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The warden interrogates him herself? Why go that far...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Lose your focus and he'll eat you alive. Be on your guard.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Whoa. You've made Uncle Ray a little nervous.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. What are you doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Questioning a prisoner. Did you forget that we're investigating as well? Or rather, have you forgotten my warning? If you value your badge... You should not have appeared before me again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry if you thought that I would abide by those words. I won't overlook something important just to head your warning. I've come for a testimony. About the truth of this case, which you have overlooked...!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. You mean to say you require my humble services.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I promised, I've returned to prove that you are the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Hm-Hmmm. Interesting... Do tell.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Before that... You should first listen to our reasoning!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We can say with confidence that Simon Keyes is the culprit. Only Simon Keyes could have moved Mr. Knightley into the prison. And we can show proof of this fact. But first... I'd like to hear your resolve, Prosecutor Edgeworth. If our reasoning is correct... Will you submit it to us? Your prosecutor's badge...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eep...! Y-You'll deprive him of his badge? I-Is that a threat, pal!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No, it's not a threat. Rather, an act of compassion. Normally, I wouldn't even have taken notice of you, since you have no right to investigate. However, if you are able to show proper resolve... ...I would be willing to let you be my opponent. Are you willing to risk it? Your prosecutor's badge...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth, sir...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. I trust my own reasoning. But moreover... ...at the moment, I am currently a defense attorney's assistant first and a prosecutor second. I will not sully the good name of the Edgeworth Law Offices.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I intend to see my job through. I won't yield to your threats!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So be it. Is this bravery, or simply foolishness? On the Goddess of Law's behalf, I shall be the judge of that. Sebastian. Allow me to...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Yeah, I got it. I'm counting on you, Justine!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I presume you know of the incident Mr. Knightley caused the day before yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, Mr. Keyes went to his cell after all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">After hearing you talk about the security camera yesterday... ...we investigated it ourselves. Why don't you have a look? I have here a printout of the security camera footage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the moment when Mr. Keyes visited Knightley...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Exactly. As you can see, the cage creates a huge blind spot in the cell. By using this blind spot, Mr. Knightley could have entered the cage... That, is our reasoning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm, a blind spot. That means... ...the camera doesn't actually show him entering the cage. At this time, there's still the possibility that Knightley never left his cell.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, why would he be hiding inside an animal cage?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Knightley was planning to escape from prison... That is the only possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A prison escape!? That's... so cool! First Mr. Elbird, and now Mr. Knightley... ...I won't let them show me up!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, this isn't the time to get excited. Jay Elbird's escape is no laughing matter.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Simon Keyes was aiding Mr. Knightley in his escape. In other words... he was an accomplice.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not bad, Simon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Don't praise him!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That cage was transported temporarily to the workroom. Originally, Mr. Knightley was to remain hidden until the end of the Animal Show... He would then be carried out along with the cage. I presume that was the plan. However, midway through the plan, he was betrayed by Simon Keyes and murdered...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney's reasoning does appear to make sense... However, there must be a hole somewhere. I must not overlook anything!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I presume you know of the incident Mr. Knightley caused the day before yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, about this incident...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You do not know of it? That would be unbecoming of you, "Ace Attorney" Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Naturally, I know of it. However, you said...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In that case, this is a waste of time. I shall continue. Mr. Knightley...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">He attacked a guard and stole his keys...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have proof Knightley stole the keys?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It is the only explanation as to why Mr. Knightley would have attacked the guard. We will know for certain the moment the guard regains consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is that really true...? Should I ask Judge Courtney for more information...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you please continue with your reasoning?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I understand... Mr. Knightley used the stolen key to leave his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is one point in your reasoning that is odd. If Knightley did indeed steal the key... I'd expect he'd try to escape immediately. Was it really necessary for him to wait for Mr. Keyes to help him escape?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">He simply chose the method with the highest probability of success. After stealing the key, he concealed it on his personage... ...as he waited for the opportune moment. That is what I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He concealed the key...?</thought> Judge Courtney. Such an oversight is unlike you. Knightley could not have concealed the key. And I can prove it. <thought>Knightley did not hide the key. And the proof is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Should I have a problem with it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhooh! <thought>I don't think that left a good impression...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Afterwards, Simon Keyes stopped by his cell with an animal cage from the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, Mr. Keyes' actions were intended to help Knightley escape from prison?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. He stopped by the detention center's holding cells with the cage. This is Simon Keyes' own testimony. It can't be denied.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>His visit to Knightley's cell ended up drawing suspicion, as one would imagine.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon was just... errr... J-Just clumsy!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">His clumsiness led him to bring the cage to the detention center. Or, he brought the cage to help Mr. Knightley escape. Which explanation do you think is more natural?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ugh...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see you understand. Simon Keyes carried the cage to the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">During this time, Mr. Knightley was able to use the stolen key to exit his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have proof Knightley stole the keys?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It is the only explanation as to why Mr. Knightley would have attacked the guard. We will know for certain the moment the guard regains consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is that really true...? Should I ask Judge Courtney for more information...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you please continue with your reasoning?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I understand... Mr. Knightley used the stolen key to leave his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is one point in your reasoning that is odd. If Knightley did indeed steal the key... I'd expect he'd try to escape immediately. Was it really necessary for him to wait for Mr. Keyes to help him escape?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">He simply chose the method with the highest probability of success. After stealing the key, he concealed it on his personage... ...as he waited for the opportune moment. That is what I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He concealed the key...?</thought> Judge Courtney. Such an oversight is unlike you. Knightley could not have concealed the key. And I can prove it. <thought>Knightley did not hide the key. And the proof is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Should I have a problem with it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhooh! <thought>I don't think that left a good impression...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">He then hid in the cage while it was moved to the prison workroom.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would he have needed to do such a thing!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In order to escape. How else would you explain his actions?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... That is...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The animal cages are made of metal. They would not have been subjected to a check. The Animal Show takes place once a month... So naturally, Simon Keyes would have known about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh... That wasn't enough to negate her point!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">As long as the cage was covered, it would have been simple to avoid the guard's eyes. ...But instead of helping Mr. Knightley escape, Simon Keyes betrayed and killed him. This is a truly unforgivable crime!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">She says Mr. Knightley stole the keys, but... He denied it, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unless Knightley had the keys, this logic doesn't hold up. This will be the breaking point. I'll try pressing the testimony further.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't the guards informed you yet? They searched Knightley after he attacked the guard, and the key was nowhere to be found. Since the key's location is unknown, your logic doesn't hold.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That is not an issue. ...There is an explanation. Mr. Knightley had the key. It simply wasn't found. The reason being, he concealed it inside the chessboard.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The chessboard... You mean the one that concealed the murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Come now. How do we know whether or not the murder weapon was really there?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What! Take some responsibility for your own words!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That was all Sebastian's idea, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, those two don't always agree on their reasoning...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In other words, once we put all the pieces together... Mr. Knightley concealed the key he stole from the guard inside the chessboard. When Simon Keyes arrived, Mr. Knightley used the key to slip out of his cell. He entered the animal cage, and was transported to the workroom. All thanks to his accomplice, Simon Keyes. Mr. Knightley had planned to be carried outside after the show had ended. However, he was betrayed by his accomplice and murdered during the circus performance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes performed in the show. He would've had no opportunity to murder him during the circus performance!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No opportunity... Is that so? A story plays itself out on the stage. And such was the case with the Animal Show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, she examined the content of the show...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The suspect plays the role of the villain who antagonizes the elephant heroine. In the final act, the villain is defeated by the heroine's love and all ends well. At that point, the suspect, in the role of the villain... ...is blown away by the heroine's burning love, and makes his exit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blown away... by the elephant?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">W-Was he hurt...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">After being blown away, the suspect disappeared from the stage. The suspect was absent from the stage for about 15 minutes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you saying the crime was committed during that time?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Even in such a short period of time, it would still be possible to carry out the murder. Don't you think so?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, he committed the crime in 15 minutes and then returned to the stage... That may have been possible, if the crime scene had been the prison... Judge Courtney. The actual crime took place in the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm afraid I cannot accept that camera footage alone as evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As for evidence... I have it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, please show us your evidence. Where is the evidence that shows the scene of the crime was the detention center?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What... is this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... This is the evidence that proves the scene of the crime was the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I do not understand.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Me too!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray too!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...A-And me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph! <thought>It seems I was mistaken.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Aren't you going to show Courtney that the detention center was the crime scene?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why don't we show her what we discovered in Mr. Knightley's cell!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Judge Courtney. Will you allow me to present another piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. Go ahead and present it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is... the floor? Oh, Goddess of Law! I am unable to comprehend your mysterious ways.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is what we discovered. The area here... was tested positive for Mr. Knightley's blood!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This blood test... Can it really be trusted? To begin with... how were you able to conduct a scientific investigation...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I happen to have a subordinate. I can't vouch for his competence, but he is a man that I trust.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That detective...? This concerns me. I cannot think why one would disturb the order of law. The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's influence goes as far as the Police Department. Ha ha ha ha.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">G-Gummy's in trouble!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Forgive me, Detective! I'm afraid something bad may come of this...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I will accept the fact that blood was found at the detention center as evidence... However...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wa ha ha ha ha! How ridiculous! This is unthinkable of you! You Third-Rate Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Debeste... You're here? <thought>I'd completely forgotten about him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">There's a giant contradiction in your statement! According to the security tape, a dog killed Knightley in his cell. Then, after he left the cell, the blood on the floor was wiped away...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aaah!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Did the dog wipe away the bloodstains? As if that could happen!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">.....That is possible. Of my Anubis. Right, boy?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha-!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That was one of the tricks I taught him while I was still in the outside world. He makes sure to hide any bloodstains he makes. Keh heh heh heh. So as not to leave behind any evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ <thought>I was saved. If only by chance.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Shouldn't you have taught your dog to "shake" or something?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh heh. Anubis also performs that trick very well. But the "shake" I taught him is a little different from others. First, he bites the victim's hand...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see... I understand. Prosecutor Edgeworth. It appears... you've gathered a good hand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm glad you understand...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">My argument isn't over yet!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Objection overruled.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hey now, that's a little harsh.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sebastian. Would you allow me the privilege of explaining?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">S-Sure, Justine.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you finally realize? The murder occurred in the detention center. Therefore that assassin's pet dog...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">My opinion has not changed. Unless I can understand how the dog was able to enter and leave the crime scene... ...I'm afraid I cannot accept your logic, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've been waiting for you to say that. Now, let me show you. This evidence shows the route the dog used to go between the detention center and prison!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...And what, pray tell, is that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the piece of evidence that shows the route the dog took!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Surely, you don't think I can accept such faulty evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... <thought>Of course, I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's show her the place where we found that secret route!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Judge Courtney. Will you allow me to present evidence once more?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Certainly. Well then, go ahead and present your evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-This photo...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It shows a secret tunnel hidden in the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Th-Th-Th-Th-That's impossible! A s-secret tunneeeeeeeeeeel?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This tunnel was dug by the escaped prisoner, Jay Elbird. It begins in his prison cell, and it's connected to a holding cell in the detention center. Namely... the victim's cell!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm shocked. How did this...!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen. You must have known of this. Since you used this tunnel to commit murder!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In the name of the Goddess of Law... I hereby reject Prosecutor Edgeworth's claim!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What do you mean!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Evidence is everything. That remains true here, just as in the courtroom. Isn't that right? I have evidence here... Horace Knightley's autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Autopsy report!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Since when!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why are YOU surprised!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This was delivered straight from the police a short while ago. It's not complete yet. More of a preliminary report. Here... The very word of the Goddess of Law is written. "Cause of Death: Stab wound to the neck, died instantly. Murder Weapon: Sharp metal object." The victim was stabbed multiple times in the same spot with a sharp object. Although they were unable to determine the actual shape of the murder weapon... ...they have clear proof that it was a sharp metal object. So, do you still stand by your claim? That a dog used a sharp object to kill the victim!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This can't beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...That is all. The court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, wait! The tunnel contains the dog's footprints!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Perhaps it may have been one of Anubis' walking courses? I can never tell what Anubis gets up to outside my cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something feels unnatural about all this, but... I have no evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Courtney-pie. You sure pulled out a hidden gem at the very last moment.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She waited for the perfect time to reveal the autopsy report. Have I let her outwit me again...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Appointed Attorney Shields. Here is the autopsy report from earlier. I apologize for the delay.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...No, it's alright. Thank you. He he he.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I gladly accept it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Shields... I don't believe it's necessary to hold hands while exchanging documents... I'd advise you to stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Persist any longer... and I shall call on the strength of the Goddess of Law.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...I-I'll be careful.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">J-Justine! Well done. Just as... I planned...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I only acted in accordance to your instructions.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The autopsy report came straight from the police. I can't refute it. However, if the murder weapon wasn't the dog, Dogen will be cleared of suspicion.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The merciful Goddess of Law so decrees: If you choose to yield now, your badge will not be taken.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-What will you do, sir? She says that, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...My answer remains the same! Judge Courtney. It is as I said before. I will see my job through. I will not yield to threats.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So even now... You still refuse to give up? If you want to keep your badge, this may be your last chance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right now... I am a defense attorney's assistant. What I protect is not my badge... ......but my client.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...The Goddess of Law grows weary of your sentiment.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he... Now we're talking. Miles is starting to understand. That a defense attorney never gives up. Actually, those were the words of your old man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...My father?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">It really is in your blood. You're the spitting image of him right now. You said it yourself, you've changed since you were tainted by Von Karma. It's only now... that I've actually come to believe it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well then, Miles. Now's the time to put those skills to the test. Think beyond your limits. If the murder weapon was a sharp object, does that really negate your reasoning...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...The murder weapon was a sharp object...? ...That's it! There were five chisels placed inside this special cell. Dogen is a "former assassin", it's quite possible he could kill someone with just a chisel. In that case, the weapon that killed Horace Knightley was...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Is that all? Well then, I suppose you'll be giving up...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Evidence is everything... Didn't you say? The murder weapon was a sharp metal object. However... Such a weapon has yet to be found.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-Wh-What! So what are you trying to say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. The only decisive evidence... is the actual murder weapon itself. And that was in plain sight this whole time. The real murder weapon is... ...Dogen's chisel!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What did you saaaaaaay!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Take responsibility for your own statements. The scene of the crime was Mr. Knightley's cell, you said so yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the evidence changes, then so will my logic. That too is courtroom procedure, is it not? If the chisel was used, that means the killer was human. However, the fact remains that we cannot deny this security photo.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y-Yeah! What about that photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the dog killed the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, you should take responsibility for you own statements.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I do intend to take full responsibility.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The real murder weapon was Mr. Dogen's chisel. Didn't you say that just a moment ago? A dog could not possibly have used a chisel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>It seems I was mistaken... If this photo doesn't show the moment of the murder, there can only be one answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">So really, what's with that photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...someone attacked the dog!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The person attacked the dog?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's obvious the person is the one being attacked!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph! <thought>As I thought, I was wrong... If this photo doesn't show the moment of the murder, there can only be one answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">So really, what's with that photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Dogen's dog leapt at Knightley. However, the victim did not die at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Didn't die...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He was only knocked unconscious. The dog didn't move a dead body. It moved the unconscious Knightley! And the real killer was... its owner!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see! If the victim was moved, it would've been possible for Dogen to commit the murder...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And use the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. The killer is... Sirhan Dogen! It can only be you!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">......Keh heh heh.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I bet your teacher used to write on your report card. "Needs to pay more attention on what others say."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I would think that describes you more.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">We examined that room. Every crook and granny. Right, Justine?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We examined all four of Mr. Dogen's chisels... ...and found no traces of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Thank you, Judge Courtney. Thanks to you, I am now certain.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Thanks to me...? Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When I came here earlier, I saw five chisels.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! There were definitely five there before!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Err... So the one that disappeared was...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the smallest one. ...Presumably for portable use. Dogen, Where is that chisel!?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I'm not free to leave this place. I've no need of a portable chisel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not free to leave? In that case, he mustn't have been free to hide the deadly chisel either.</thought> Hmph... Dogen, you just dug your own grave.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems you know something. Would you care to show it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Dogen couldn't leave, so the place he hid the chisel is...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It must be here in the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Because of the security gate, that's probably the case...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're supposed to point out where in the prison it's hidden!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... I know that. <thought>What was I thinking...! Dogen didn't have time to take the chisel out of the cell. In that case, there's only one place he could have hidden it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen is a prisoner... So he can't leave his cell freely. Perhaps he could have sent his dog out to dispose of it... ...but he would not have been able to confirm the weapon's location.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh heh. So, what does that leave?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Above all else... Special metal tools are allowed in this cell. Even if one chisel were to appear here, no one would suspect a thing. You'd be a fool not to take advantage of that!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see. Of course, it's always safest if you do something yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But, I examined everything! I didn't find any hiding places in his cell!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am certain that the murder weapon is here. The reason you haven't found it is because it was cleverly hidden.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh. You say I hid it? Where, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Think... Where could he have hidden it? I have to remember everything up to this point! There must be some clue...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, does this mean... What I think it means?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">L-L-L-Let's get going, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Come to think of it... That dog hasn't barked at me once today. Previously, when I came to the special cell, it barked on Dogen's command. Th-That's it! That's what's been out of place! There's just one place he could have hidden the murder weapon!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Giving up already? Keh heh heh. How dull, how dull.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will... present evidence. This piece of evidence shows where you concealed the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. And what is that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is where you hid the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles. Wouldn't you think that's impossible...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! ...I know. <thought>The unnatural feeling I had when I came to this cell... That's where the chisel is.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. I never hid anything like a chisel. Ready to give up?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, you did hide the chisel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hasn't your dog been awfully quiet today?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Now that you mention it, it hasn't barked at all. Before it was...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sirhan Dogen! Open that dog's mouth, now!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Anubis doesn't bark needlessly. I ordered him to do that before.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, order it to bark now!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Naturally, you should be able to. If you have nothing to hide...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">............ It was inevitable. Anubis, show them your mouth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As you can see, a dog of this size can easily conceal a small chisel in its...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAT! Why a chisel? The dog really had one in its mouth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought he was unusually quiet. Was he unable to follow the discussion?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........Sebastian. Could you call the Forensics Department? Urgently, please.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ugh! I got it!</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">A-A reaction! This chisel tests positive for blood!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">WH-WHAAAAAAT!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I guess that proves my theory wasn't just nonsense.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">........</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Would this chisel be the murder weapon then?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It reacted positively for blood. There is no doubt about that.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Sirhan Dogen. Now that the murder weapon has been found... I must ask you for your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen hid this chisel inside his dog's mouth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Could this be the murder weapon of this case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't say for certain... However, traces of blood were found on the chisel. At the very least, it's not unrelated to the case...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This bell, it's the same as the one that's attached to Anubis' collar.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It's the Assassin Dogen's trademark.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">An assassin with a trademark... What an odd combination!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you think it's similar to the Great Thief Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, you don't understand anything! A Great Thief has to stand out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why would a thief want to stand out...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We know how your dog got to the detention center, and we've found the murder weapon... Do you still think you can talk your way out of this?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh heh. Interesting.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-This guy. Even at a time like this, he's still smiling...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Well, Anubis. It seems everyone has become suspicious of you. It's quite troubling, but since it has come to this, we have no choice but to tell the truth. I did not kill anyone. I've long since grown weary of killing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What's this? His face looks completely composed.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems we'll need to listen to Mr. Dogen's explanation. Please promptly give your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh. Certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">First of all, I would like you to explain my motive.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I do not hunger for blood so much as to kill a man I do not even know.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uuugh... Coming from an assassin, it sure is persuasive.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. An assassin who only kills acquaintances? I doubt that would be profitable.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I may kill strangers in my line of work, but I never make it personal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is there evidence that shows a connection between Knightley and Dogen... I should thoroughly review the evidence once more.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">First of all, I would like you to explain my motive.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You cannot kill without a motive. ...Hardly what I'd expect an assassin to say.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. I don't spill blood needlessly. It may be required for my job, but not in my personal affairs. They're a little different. Isn't that right, Anubis?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I do not know anyone by the name of Knightley. We share no connection.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't know Knightley? It's not like you to say something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">You overestimate me considerably. Did you have such a hard time arresting me in the past?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...We've already looked into it. You are the prison's Supplier. Naturally, you would have known about the other prisoners.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. Hearing one thing and knowing ten is just an ideal. It's true, I do hear things. However, that doesn't mean that I know everything. I've never heard of anyone named Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">So, I wouldn't think some motive for murder would just appear out of nowhere.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are an assassin. You do not require a motive to kill.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Hey, Anubis. What do you think of this man? Is he an idiot, a fool... or possibly even a genius?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You can drop the act. Answer the question.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">But first, consider this. Who am I? Before your eyes, you see the man you arrested yourself... The assassin Sirhan Dogen. For those I have needlessly killed, I chant a prayer.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Or are you insinuating my Anubis had a motive?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The dog probably did not have a motive. However, it has been trained to kill.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Anubis, how could this man say such a thing? You poor thing. There there. There there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The dog isn't you. He could have mistaken his target!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">In that case, wouldn't police dogs be equally untrustworthy? If you still mean to suspect Anubis... Then you'll have to show me this "evidence" you're so fond of.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...! <thought>I don't have that kind of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. He only bares his fangs at others on my command.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, perhaps you ordered him to kill Knightley!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh. Aren't we impatient? Haven't you forgotten the first thing I said? I don't know anyone called Knightley. Although you still insist I do, I'm afraid there's no evidence. Don't you think so too, Anubis? Good boy. Good boy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Did the dog kill him, or did Dogen... If Dogen did not have the motive to kill, then he could not have murdered Knightley. First, I should show proof of some connection between Dogen and Knightley.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You've lost your touch, Sirhan Dogen. If you had your dog clean up after you, you should have disposed of this too. This is a record of a correspondence chess game found in the victim's cell. This record, and the chessboard in your cell... Both clearly depict the same game.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Wh-What...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've heard that the number of possible chess positions is around 10¹².</line>
<line speaker="Kay">10 x 10, 120 times. 100, 1000... Umm... I-Is that even a real number!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There's absolutely no way these two could have coincided by chance.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tell us your reason for killing Knightley! Unless you intend to explain this as a coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">........Keh. Keh heh heh. Well. Don't they say that the truth is stranger than fiction? It is as you said. This is merely a coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-But there's no way that could have happened!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">My correspondence chess opponent was the victim in this incident? What a horrible coincidence. Aren't you shocked too, Anubis?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Looks like I'll have to tell them the truth. Anubis, my boy. The Animal Show, or something. That was when everyone left. Anubis brought the body to my cell... Keh heh heh. He had already been stabbed in the neck with the murder weapon. I did not wish to be suspected. So I had Anubis carry the body to the workroom. After that, he pulled out the murder weapon and returned to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you're saying the one who pulled the weapon out was Anubis?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That's right. If I pulled out the murder weapon here, the blood would have been a problem.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't this what that Sahwit guy said...</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">A large black dog... ...was biting into the neck of the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha-! What did you say!</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">It was a truly hellish scene... That dog! That dog killed him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... So that means Sahwit witnessed the moment the murder weapon was pulled out.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Oh, yes. That prisoner's testimony. It surprised me when I first heard it. It's not often that Anubis makes a blunder like that. Right, boy? Now, I believe that explains my actions. I did not kill him. All I did was remove the murder weapon. Now, will that be all? Anubis is getting tired.</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Whoa there. Just a moment. Mr. Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Isn't there one thing you haven't explained? Why would you need to pull out the murder weapon in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's right... I understand why he'd move the body to draw suspicion away from him. But, he didn't need to retrieve the murder weapon!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I thought him just a fool, but how quickly his scent has changed.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Care to elaborate, Mr. Dogen?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">It was... because of this bell. The bell attached to the murder weapon, and the bell on my dog's neck... They share a distinctive shape, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The assassin Sirhan Dogen's trademark...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">An assassin's trademark?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The blind assassin... Sirhan Dogen. He always appears at the sound of a bell. The sound of a bell ringing in the dark of night is said to be the last thing his target hears.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh. You remember well. It has been a while since you last saw my bells, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When I prosecuted you in court, I confiscated a knife with the bell attached to it.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Yes. My bells... There are only two in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Only two?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">They're custom-made. Attached to my knife and Anubis' collar. Even though I can only rely on my ears... ...I can easily identify them. Alas, one has been confiscated and is not in my possession.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">When Anubis brought the body here, I heard a familiar sound. I thought my knife must have been embedded in the body. So imagine my confusion when I found out that it was merely a chisel with my bell attached.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, your knife is nothing like this chisel.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Either way, those bells are my trademark. Moreover, I'm the only one in this prison who uses chisels. With all this, I knew I would be falsely suspected. So, I removed the murder weapon and hid it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're claiming that you only moved the body!?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Didn't I tell you? That chisel isn't mine. If you think I'm lying... Go ahead and check for my fingerprints.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sebastian!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Eh? M-Me? But how do I check for...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Forensics!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y-Yes, maaaaaaam!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">A r-r-rr... Reaction! We have fingerprints! They're Knightley's, Justine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What about Dogen's!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Nope, just Knightley's... And there's no evidence of prints being wiped either.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Only Knightley's fingerprints? I-It can't be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Um... Should we re-examine it?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. See now? I never even touched that chisel. Because I ordered Anubis to carry it in his mouth. In other words, the fingerprints belong to the chisel's original owner!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The murder weapon's owner... was the victim? Hrmmm. This is perplexing.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">At any rate, I did not touch the murder weapon. In other words, the killer could not have been me... Isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah! I have nothing to refute that...! H-How could this...! Is he really... not the killer? Could Dogen's testimony actually be... true? This... can't be...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems this is sufficient enough not to warrant any further explanation... As it stands, you have not changed the state of this case... I believe this is more than enough reason for us to relieve you of your badge. To save any needless fuss, I'd suggest you hand over your badge now.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Th-This is bad, sir! They sound serious!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...It's regrettable, but... With those prints as decisive evidence, I'll have to rethink my logic from step one...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But... there are still many unexplained things. Why would Mr. Knightley be carrying a chisel?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">It could be used for many things. Perhaps even prison escapes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then... How did he carry it into the prison? I mean, the prisoners aren't even allowed cutlery... Right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Even if your reasoning is off at first, you shouldn't let that confuse you. The most important thing is to arrive at the truth! Isn't that right? It doesn't matter how you get there. The end result is to save Simon! We have to do everything we can for his sake!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well said, Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Nice one, Kay. I really want to scout you for the law firm now. Remember when Uncle Ray said, "A defense attorney never gives up"? Miles, do you understand the true meaning behind those words?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The true meaning... of those words?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Defense attorneys carry the fate of their client on their shoulders. You are the only person your client can rely on... Just like with Mr. Keyes. We're the only ones who can save him now. We are linked by fate to our clients... That is why we must never give up. There's no way Uncle Ray can go against the teachings of Gregory. So... what will you do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...... Currently, I am a defense attorney's assistant; no, an assistant at my father's firm... I have made a commitment to this case. Therefore... ...If I don't save my client, I cannot say I've achieved it. ...I will abide by this. To save Simon Keyes...! No matter how many times my logic fails, I will always find another possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK! You're finally back! Well then, let's search for that other possibility! To start with... Do you think there was a way Mr. Knightley could've brought the chisel into the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The method Knightley used to bring the chisel into the prison was...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was how Knightley brought the chisel inside!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And could you explain how this allowed him to do so?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Don't you understand?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I'm afraid I cannot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>So it's not this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Was there really a way for him to bring the chisel inside? Didn't someone mention something about that earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. <thought>Why do they suspect Mr. Keyes... The answer lies there!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It would appear you have no thoughts on the matter.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Judge Courtney. Please allow me to present evidence once more.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. Please show us your evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They'd just be caught by the security gate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, there is one way to avoid this. And that is, if they're sent in a package to the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That gate is only used on people. In other words, packages sent to the detention center undergo a simpler check.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So they don't use a metal detector for that?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This never should have happened... It seems the guards were too careless.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knowing this, Knightley asked Simon to send him a package. Namely, a chessboard containing the chisel!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Well, this has solved one of our problems. The fact that the chisel was not Mr. Dogen's, but Mr. Knightley's.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Given this... One major issue remains. The security camera shows a dog attacking the victim... As long as that exists, I will maintain that Dogen is the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But, Dogen never touched the murder weapon. ...I'm stumped.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We also desire a conclusion to this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! We can use one of my secret weapons, sir! Secret Weapon No. 4! The video analyzing machine: Mr. Analysis!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's with that ridiculous name!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I-I named it myself, sir... This'll let us analyze video footage in detail.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Go ahead. You'll soon see I'm not lying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't know what will come of this but... All we can do now is investigate!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! Do you know how to use Mr. Analysis??</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A video analysis machine... Should I hear how to use it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. Could you show me how to use it?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Of course, sir! Fundamentally, it's the same as investigating a crime scene. You just Examine anything that piques your curiosity!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>To Examine I just press the X Button...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Now, I'd like you to look at the buttons below the monitor! The left and right buttons will rewind and fast forward, respectively. And the center button lets you pause the video... Let's make good use of it to advance our investigation, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>To rewind and fast forward, I use the Y and A Buttons. And to pause I use the B Button.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">While paused, you can go to the previous frame or the next frame! You just use the same left and right buttons as before, sir. Next, I'll explain how to zoom in! Just point the cursor at the area you want to zoom in on and... ...press the button on the upper left of Mr. Analysis! The one that says Zoom+!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems I can also use L Button to zoom in.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">And after you've zoomed in, you can Examine it just like you would the original image! Use the previous frame and next frame buttons to Examine frame by frame! But, you can't actually playback the video in this mode, so keep that in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what should I do if I want to zoom out?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Just press the top left button on Mr. Analysis again, sir! Now, it should say Zoom-. And that concludes the explanation, sir! Well then, let's turn on Mr. Analysis.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. I see no particular need for an explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! Alright, let's turn on Mr. Analysis and get started.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is the video from the detention center's camera... I believe this was the moment when Knightley was being attacked by the dog... If that wasn't the case, then what does it show? Is the person in this video really Knightley...? And what is the true form of the black silhouette attacking this person...? I should check the video and try to find the answers to these two questions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">There could be unexpected things in unexpected places! So be sure to check every nook and cranny of the video, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What part of video is strange?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th... This is...! I fear we have made a grave miscalculation! This animal... This silhouette... No matter how you look at it, it is not a dog. This animal is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This silhouette is definitely a cat.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...A cat?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">No matter how hard I try, Uncle Ray can't see a cat.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please be more serious with your answers!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>I-I was being serious... I should have another look at the animal seen in the video.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This silhouette is clearly a pig.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...A pig!? Now that you say it, it has to be...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I certainly cannot see anything resembling a pig.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now, now. I'm sure that Miles here was just joking, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......! <thought>I was being serious...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What!? It was a joke!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please be more serious with your answers!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>That must have left a bad impression... I should have another look at the animal seen in the video.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From the silhouette, I'd say the animal is not a dog, but a bear.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, in that photo I took...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Those footprints must have belonged to this bear, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hm? Did you say a bear...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That man is the first to come to mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that we know this black shadow isn't a dog, but a bear... There's a good possibility that the man being attacked is not Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Whatever can show that this man isn't Knightley... ...should be somewhere in the video, wouldn't it, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since his face is not visible, it would be difficult to get direct confirmation. However... perhaps there is something indirectly reflected.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Something reflected...? Hey, isn't there a mirror in the cell, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... That could be worth examining.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A reflection of this person can be seen in this mirror. Hm? Is that a cap on his head...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Actually, it looks kinda like the caps the prison guards wear, sir! You don't think... it was a guard who was attacked?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Have you received a report of any guard being attacked by an animal?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No, not that I've heard, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm. Then it was someone else wearing a guard's uniform... I see. I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The cap in this video is clearly this!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh? That doesn't look like it at all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......Ngh! ...I'll try thinking it over again. The person in this video is wearing a guard's uniform. But they're not a guard. In that case, why would they choose to appear this way...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was no report of a guard being attacked by an animal. However, we did hear that a guard's uniform was stolen. Putting two and two together... I'd say this was... a disguise. For the purpose of a prison escape...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">D-Disguised as a guard...! That sounds like it could have been successful, sir. Huh? Speaking of prison escapes...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That person certainly was successful.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the person in this video is not Knightley... Then perhaps that black shadow is not a dog either.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">If you zoom in, you should be able to see its real shape, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nothing here... I should have another look at the video. Maybe I'll find something if I make use of the zoom feature.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, it's his cell after all. Why would it be anyone else...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That line of logic no longer holds. Remember the tunnel under his bed!? It's possible whoever used this tunnel is the one in this video!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems it is time to answer that question. Just who is the person in this video...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person in this video is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaah! The person in this video is really them!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the only possibility...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No, it's not.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can see a bear in this video... Isn't there someone in the prison who keeps a bear?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It's likely they are the one in this video. Judge Courtney. Will you give me permission to speak once more?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. So, who is this person...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person wearing the guard's uniform is... ...the escaped prisoner, Jay Elbird. The probability is extremely high. His pet is a polar bear cub.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, but! The bear here is black!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We have evidence that can explain this matter. The reason the polar bear became black is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That is what turned the polar bear black?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray can't understand why that would turn it black either.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Would you care to provide an explanation?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I-I can understand it even without his explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please refrain from making such meaningless statements.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>It wasn't this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Elbird's polar bear. I'm sure it was under the care of Mr. Sahwit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. The answer must lie in something that happened at that time! Judge Courtney, will you allow me to present evidence once more?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In the name of the Goddess of Law, I will allow it. Please present your evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Think back to Frank Sahwit's testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">! That's the rubber glove I dropped.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Where did the mud on this glove come from?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Ahh. That's the mud from my mud packs. At the time I was practicing applying my mud packs.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell me when this took place on the day of the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Since the Animal Show had started... I'd say it was around 9 AM. The mud packs turned the animals' bodies pitch black! And my heart was pure white...! I was totally engrossed with covering the animals in mud!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">During the Animal Show, Mr. Sahwit was applying mud packs to the animals.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, then, among those animals...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was this polar bear... Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. There is a huge contradiction in your argument. The security camera footage...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. You are quite right. Sahwit used the mud packs during the Animal Show. Knowing this, a new contradiction in the video comes to light.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A new contradiction?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Do you know when this footage was taken?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It was after the mud packs were used, that would put it at around 9 AM.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, you should notice something strange about this video.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? What's strange about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The strange thing that contradicts the time this video was taken is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's the contradiction?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So where, specifically, is the contradiction?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Specifically, around here...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm afraid I cannot accept such unclear terms.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>So it wasn't here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Is there really something strange in this video!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And I'll show it to you now. <thought>The video was taken at around 9 AM... In that case, there is something obviously strange about this video.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The time Sahwit covered the polar bear in mud was around 9 AM... Which means this video should also have been taken at 9 AM. However, the timestamp reads 6 AM! On that day, the prisoners went to the courtyard to watch the Animal Show. At this time, only three people remained behind. Dogen in the special cell... Sahwit in the workroom, applying his mudpacks... And the one who put his escape plan in motion at that moment, Jay Elbird. Elbird left the polar bear in Sahwit's care and entered the secret tunnel. However, the bear escaped from Sahwit and followed after its owner. And just as he was chasing after the escaped bear, Sahwit happened to witness... ...the dog pulling the murder weapon out of the body. If Sahwit's testimony is correct, this video must have been taken at around 9 AM. However, the timestamp is off by three hours.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why would the timestamp be off like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to examine the security camera.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! I asked all the guards and... ...it seems the camera's power was cut off for a moment, throwing off the timestamp.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The camera is an old model, so if it loses power, the clock stops as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, this means the camera's power was cut for three hours...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">While I'm at it, I've got some more information for you, sir. You heard that Knightley denied stealing the key, right? It seems nobody would believe the words of a criminal, but... ...Knightley testified, "I was knocked out too."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That may not necessarily be a lie...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">My, my, my. There you all are! Making progress in your investigation? Can I be of any help?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Actually, Warden Roland, there is something we must report to you. The escaped prisoner... Jay Elbird, is most likely still inside the prison. He has disguised himself. Here is the proof. The person visible in this security video is Elbird. So, perhaps, he's still in this very building...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Come to think of it, didn't Mr. Elbird have a bracelet like the other prisoners?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The bracelet would have been concealed under the uniform's sleeves. Moreover... ...the prison's main gate does not have a sensor to detect bracelets. All he would have to do is avoid any doors with sensors inside the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Th-That's right. So, if he didn't enter the cells or the workrooms... ...could one of you guys be Jay Elbird...!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Rocky!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">S-Stop it! What are you doing!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would seem that Rocky has answered that question for us.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">........Ngh. NOOOOOOOOOO! Rocky! This is all your fault!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The little guy loves you so much, it's enviable.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Right then! Seize him at once!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wait. There's something we must hear from this prisoner. It's necessary if we are to find the truth. I'd like permission to interrogate him.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...Understood.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">...What do you want out of me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Elbird's escape route is linked to Knightley's cell. So it's highly likely he knows something about the crime!</thought> I'd like to ask you about the day the body was found.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">So it was you guys? You were the ones who found my secret tunnel!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Damn! If only you guys hadn't shown up! If only Knightley hadn't died!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You say you dug the tunnel. What did you use to dig it?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Oh, that... Just hammers... and spoons. Stuff like that. I bought them from the Supplier! But it was all for nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. No need to lose your temper. There's always next time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>On the day of the incident, it's possible that Elbird met Knightley while he was alive. I'll have to listen to his testimony carefully.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Elbird">So it was you guys? You were the ones who found my secret tunnel!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You...</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Shuddup! What's with that "Hold it", punk!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You say you dug...</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">What's it to you! You know how long it took me to dig that!? I had to beg the Supplier for those tools! Day after day, I slaved away! Give me back my hard work! Give it back, you sonuva...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't get a word in edgewise.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Elbird">You can't just go around discovering people's holes!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">It took me ages to dig that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you dug that hole alone?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">You're damn right I did!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could a tunnel like that really be dug by one person?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow... Such a wasted effort.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">A kid like you wouldn't understand. Never rely on others. Never let others see you. Those are the rules we live by in here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well... as a Great Thief, I kinda see where you're coming from.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay, don't agree with him.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, no! I was just joking!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Well, I wasn't! Damn, why'd it come to this!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">The day the body was found was the day I had planned to escape. I was in disguise.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you obtain the guard's uniform from the Supplier too?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Yeah... That's right. Seems he got it by threatening a guard. That guy went and stole it from someone's locker.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, when you went through the tunnel, you were already dressed like a guard?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">No. To ensure that the clothes wouldn't get stained with mud, I carried them with me. Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple. And that's when... Rocky ran up and jumped on me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That must be the moment the security camera captured. I see. Could you add that to your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple."</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Getting out the cell door was "simple", you say...?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Yeah. Compared to going through the tunnel, it was very simple.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You inhabit a prison. Yet, you seem to know the layout of the detention center quite well.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">! Wh-What's so wrong about that? Sure, I've been to the detention center too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In that case, he should have known about it from the start. When Knightley was in his cell, the door would've been locked! Which means there was one piece of evidence Elbird needed to escape.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Then, Rocky followed after me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When did you first realize he was following you?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">When I got out of the tunnel. Just when I thought I pulled it off ...Damn!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't you notice anything when you entered the tunnel?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">He wasn't there at the time. I knew he would follow me if he was around. This is my chance! I thought... Just my luck, damn it...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Such harsh words... Poor Rocky...</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I-I can't help it! Today was his fault too! Just like yesterday, always clinging onto me!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">But he was all covered in mud. I panicked and returned to my cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't consider just making a run for it?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I would have if I could! But the mud would've given me away. And it's not like I'd get another chance like this. So, I had to proceed with caution.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In the end, he was exposed by his own bear.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's possible that Elbird met Knightley before he died. I should listen to his testimony carefully, and review the evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You say it was simple getting through the cell door?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even though you managed to arrive at Knightley's cell, opening the door wasn't so simple. How did you intend to unlock the cell door? Jay Elbird! You... had the key to Knightley's cell!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">...! I ain't got... nothing like that. Th-That's it! It was open! It was already unlocked when I got there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, the cell was vacant after Knightley's death. Which is why... ...at the time we conducted out investigation, it was unlocked. Your successful escape attempt occurred after Knightley's death. So the door would've been open. However, you had tried to escape once before then!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The plan was foiled thanks to Rocky; the video shows it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That was during the Animal Show. Before Knightley's death was known! And the cell door was locked! Because no one knew he was dead! Without the key to Knightley's cell, your escape would have been impossible!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Guh... Gwaaaarrgh!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That means... It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's exactly what you think. In the case of the stolen key, the culprit is... ...Jay Elbird! You were the one who attacked the guard, weren't you? The guard... and Knightley too! In order to steal the cell key!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I-It wasn't me! I don't know any Knightley!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After stealing the key, you returned to your cell, as a precautionary measure. Then, you waited for a time when the prison would be mostly vacant. That was just before Knightley's death became known. In other words, during the Animal Show! But in the end, the plan was foiled thanks to Rocky...</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Don't screw with me! If you don't have evidence, I'll still win by decision! Besides, it was that Knightley guy who attacked the guard, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think not. Regarding the theft of the keys, Knightley was the victim! This proves Knightley was the victim who was attacked in his cell...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Does this really prove it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">If you say so, then I get the feeling he was definitely the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. This evidence proves nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh! Really... I knew that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>It's not easy to fool Judge Courtney. I have to remember the state of Knightley's cell. I have to show what happened between those two!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">As I thought, you don't have proof, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In Knightley's cell, there were traces of his blood, which had been wiped away. I believe this is more than enough proof Knightley was attacked in his cell. You attacked those two people and stole the key, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Gwaaaaaaaaarrgh! ...Damn! I never thought you'd find the bloodstain I wiped away with the newspaper...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why would you go through all the trouble of wiping the bloodstain?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">On the hands of Knightley and the guard, there were obvious signs of a scuffle, you know. If the bloodstains were uncovered, they'd find out there was another attacker! And if anyone looked around the bed, the tunnel I dug would be discovered!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you were trying to buy more time for your escape attempt. But I'm afraid to say your plan still ended in failure. Now then... Hand over the keys to Knightley's cell!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Guh... Gwoooh! Urgh! Gwaaaarrgh! D... a... mn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit! No way... How could an amateur like you knock me out! Here. I got the keys right here.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn> If you have that key, then that means...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right, Judge Courtney. You reasoned that Knightley stole the key and used it to leave his cell... From there, he entered Mr. Keyes' cage and was moved to the workroom. However... The very foundation of that hypothesis has collapsed!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Aaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">HOOOOOOOOOOOOW!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see. In that case... ...there was only one person who could have moved Knightley. The criminal must have been someone who knew about the secret tunnel.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">...H-Hey! A-Are you suggesting...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Jay Elbird! You're under arrest, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">W-Wait! I didn't do nothin'! Sure, I knocked out those two guys. Then, I stole the keys! And after that, I waited for the perfect time to enter that guy's cell. But, the cell was empty then! There was no dead body either. And also, how could I have gotten into the workroom? I couldn't even leave my own cell, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's true, you only had the key to Knightley's cell. But... there's also Dogen's dog.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Wha?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It'd be possible for the dog to carry the body from the cell to the workroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see... So, you're saying there was an accomplice!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The crime would've been possible if Elbird and Dogen were working together. It's perfectly plausible. Somehow Elbird managed to carry Knightley's body to his own cell...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...and then, the dog must've carried it to the workroom!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, because all the animals can move freely in the prison. But that's not the case for the path between the detention center and the prison. The only one who could use that route was you, Jay Elbird!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">What if there was another route that you didn't know about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. There couldn't have been. The tunnel is a straight path, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Yeah, seems like it. I didn't have enough time to dig any more than I did. I only dug halfway up the corridor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What? You mean to say that you didn't dig the entire tunnel?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">When I got to that cell, the tunnel was already there. There was a tunnel linking my cell to the well. Looking down the well from the courtyard, there's no mistaking it. They've always been connected.. I just continued the tunnel with my digging.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was that hole doing there in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Who knows. Maybe another inmate dug it in an attempt to escape?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Or maybe the animals dug it! Maybe they wanted to drink from the well?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's highly doubtful...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Elbird">There's no water in that well anymore. It's all dried up. Hm? Wait a minute. That's it. For some reason, that well gave off a nice scent.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A nice scent?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I don't know what it was, but it smelled sweet, like candy...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This scent... I believe we've come across it before. <thought>We know this scent from...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is it, by chance, this scent? Here, have a sniff.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">*sniff* *sniff*... Nope, it wasn't this smell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? <thought>I must have been mistaken... When we found the tunnel, we followed some kind of scent... That must be the answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley's body was giving off a sweet, candy-like scent. We used a police dog to track that scent. And that led us to discover the tunnel.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By any chance, could this be the same scent as the well?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, I know what you're trying to say. That the scent proves the body was carried down through the tunnel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. And... Jay Elbird! You are the only one who could have used the tunnel!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Thank you, Mr. Elbird. I am very grateful to you. At last... At last the truth comes to light. Mr. Elbird, wouldn't it be wise to confess now? To being an accomplice, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Don't tell me even you suspect me too?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, it seems you and I have come to the same conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Not at all. Our thoughts on this matter are still quite different. Mr. Elbird was certainly an accomplice, but an accomplice to Horace Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Elbird did not move the body. He simply lent the victim his keys.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wha!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It would seem Mr. Elbird did indeed strike Mr. Knightley on the head. However... Mr. Knightley was not knocked out. The two must have made a little negotiation.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Negotiation?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">For Mr. Knightley's escape plan to work, he would have needed the keys to his cell. So, Mr. Elbird stole them from the guard... On the other hand, for Mr. Elbird to escape, he needed to get to Mr. Knightley's cell. But, if Mr. Knightley had seen him and yelled, the plan would have gone down the drain. .....And so, they "negotiated".</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I-I didn't negotiate nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Oh? You still intend to deny it?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see. So, in other words, we're back where we started.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Elbird opened the cell door, and Mr. Knightley entered Mr. Keyes' cage. And then, he was moved into the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Of course! And then he was killed in the prison workroom!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Weren't you listening? The scent on the body shows it must have been moved through the tunnel! Knightley was moved from the detention center through the tunnel...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Please wait until someone is finished before speaking. I do not claim that he wasn't moved through the tunnel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y-You don't?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The scent shows that the body was moved through the tunnel. However, that does not mean it came from the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What do you mean? That sure sounds like a contradiction to me...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Isn't there one more possibility? The well in the courtyard... It's possible the body was dropped down from there.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The courtyard...? Ahh! The well in the courtyard!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Keyes carried the cage not to the workroom, but to the courtyard. Mr. Knightley was killed in the courtyard and his body was dropped down the well. And then, the body at the bottom of the well was moved by Mr. Dogen's dog. Now... there's one thing I'd like you all to remember. Before the body was discovered... What was happening in the courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The Animal Show, right? Regina and Simon were there. ...Wait? Simon? ...Aaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see you understand. Who then, dropped the body drown the well?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney... She's a tough opponent. Her flexible way of thinking enables her to adapt and come up with her own deductions...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Knightley was not carried to the workroom but to the courtyard... And Mr. Keyes was off stage for 15 minutes. This was when he dropped Mr. Knightley down the well. It's as simple as that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, your reasoning is sound, I'll admit that. However, let's say the body was dropped down the well... That didn't have to be done during the show, it could have happened at a different time!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Unfortunately for you, Prosecutor Edgeworth, that is not possible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When the show started, Mr. Elbird was in the tunnel, on his way to the cell block. Mr. Elbird. At that time, did you happen to see a body in the tunnel?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Nope... Nothing like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So, if the body had been dropped before the show... Mr. Elbird would have seen it. However, he has stated he did not see a body. So it is impossible to think the body was dropped before the show. And after the show, the body was discovered in the workroom... In other words! The body being dropped down the well and then moved to the workroom... ...could only have been done during the show. And the only one who could have done it is Simon Keyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What should we do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If the body was moved through the well, that does put Mr. Keyes at a major disadvantage.</thought> However! The notion that the body was moved through the well is only a hypothesis. That doesn't mean there is "evidence."</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">..... I am obligated to recognize that fact.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Will you allow me to investigate the courtyard once more?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....I give my approval, in the name of the Goddess of Law.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Reinvestigating the courtyard... I fear this may be out final chance! Huh? What?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">F-Fire!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Could be another prison break, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Sh-Should we evacuate?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Everyone! Please remain calm! This is just the signal for the evening meal. It's a little loud, so I can understand why you'd be surprised.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sure scared me.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I'm terribly sorry. And with that, everyone! Please return to your posts! Jay Elbird, it's also time for you to return to your room.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Ugh... Bah! I got it! .....Let's go, Rocky.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Warden Roland. We will be proceeding to the courtyard for another investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Isn't it time for you to go home as well, Mr. Edgeworth? It looks like we're out of time. Why don't you continue this another time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">B-But! The investigation...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Today's been a big day, right? With the escaped prisoner and all. So, I'm afraid I can't let outsiders like you loiter around any longer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">This is my decision as the warden of this prison.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Looks like it can't be helped. The warden's word can be called the law of the prison. Prosecutor Edgeworth. This means we will have to carry out our investigation another day. Until then, you may hold on to your Prosecutor's Badge. And with that, I leave you.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Now, I think it's time you all left...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Well, it looks like we'll have to continue the investigation tomorrow. Knightley's body was dropped down the well... And was carried to the workroom from Mr. Elbird's cell. This is Judge Courtney's logic, but is it correct? And... ...Judge Courtney claims that Mr. Keyes transported him, but... ...was Mr. Keyes really the only one with a chance to move him?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Let's do our best tomorrow! We have to save Simon, no matter what!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, I agree. <thought>I must prove Mr. Keyes' innocence without fail...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The courtyard... Depending on what we find here, the entire incident could become clear. However...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's nothing left here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yesterday...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Isn't there one more possibility? The well in the courtyard... It's possible the body was dropped down from there.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In other words! The body being dropped down the well and then moved to the workroom... ...could only have been done during the show. And the only one who could have done it is Simon Keyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was the body dropped down the well or not? This could be the decisive clue that we need to reach the truth of the matter. Before I continue with the investigation, I should organize my evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's see here... Hey, there's a grate here!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The well has run dry, after all. They even put a lock on it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Lock picking is one of my specialties! Wanna see?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is absolutely no need for you to show off.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, c'mon. Don't be like that... Whoa!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What happened, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The lock is broken! Judging from the looks of it... It feels like it was broken some time ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So the lock was broken... This means that anyone could have dropped the body down this well.</thought> According to Judge Courtney's reasoning, Mr. Keyes murdered Knightley in the courtyard. And then, during the show, he disposed of the body in the well...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You think so? Did he really use the well to move the body?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, I know! Let's get Missile to help us out again! He should be able to track the scent of the body!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good idea. Let me contact Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! Detective Gumshoe here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, I have a favor to ask of you. We would like for you to bring Missile to the prison courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sounds like you need the help of one of my "Seven Secret Weapons" again, huh, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought Missile belonged to the police department.</thought> And also, I would like for you to contact a witness. Please contact Regina Berry of the Berry Big Circus and bring her here.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Roger that, sir! I'll bring them over in a flash!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, what should we do while we wait for Gummy? How about some hide-and-seek?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What are you talking about, Kay? There's nowhere to hide here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think that is the issue.</thought> Kay. During times like this, isn't it your turn to shine?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, that! You want me to re-create the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh? How do ya do that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">See for yourself! The great Thief's secret weapon, Little Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Whoa! What's that? Screens floating in midair...! Just what are you doing, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm entering the information needed for the simulation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields, this "Little Thief"... ...is a tool that can re-create a crime scene based on the information it is given.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Should I set it for how this place was like when we came here yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I believe they were in the middle of taking down the set. We didn't pay enough attention to the well, so it's possible we may have missed a clue.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Leave it to me. I took a picture of the place too! There, there, there aaaaand there! Data entry complete! Now to set the projection to maximum output... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? What just happened!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I re-created the courtyard from yesterday based on the information I entered! This was a tool the previous Yatagarasu used. It's a device to run simulations to practice stealing things.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But used in this manner, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, but it's still only a re-creation based on what information we have! I can't re-create what I don't have information for, and if my information is incorrect... The re-creation could come out strange, too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In this case, since Kay had the photo, there should be no problems.</thought> Now, let's begin the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Since it's a re-creation, you can examine things just like you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I know. <thought>First, I should start with that well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It'd be nice if we could come up with an alibi for Simon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do not bring in your personal feelings or you won't be able to conduct a proper investigation. Information should be collected calmly and swifty.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see! It's just like how Mr. Edgeworth never shows any emotion; When you analyze your opponents with that icy glare!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Do I really come across as such a cold person...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's the exact moment of the murder! ...Or so we thought. Actually, the footage shows Mr. Elbird and Rocky the polar bear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like this will be the compelling piece of evidence we need. But, according to the timestamp from the security camera, there are three hours missing. Why did the security camera lose power for three hours?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It was probably just a power outage!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wonder... Is that really what happened...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's examine the area around the well. It holds the key to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? There are some pulleys here... They don't appear to be the pulley that was used to lift the bucket from the well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The well was behind the stage. That means...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Only a few people would have access to dump the body in the well during the performance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This isn't looking good for Mr. Keyes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a sturdy hemp rope.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like the rope they use for tug-of-wars.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I'm not going to play tug-of-war with you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I didn't even say anything yet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a metal stake attached to the end of the rope.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! You use these to pin down the tent when you go camping!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It doesn't seem like they'd need this for the performance... I wonder what it was used for?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is... a metal weight. It weighs... It's hard to see in the re-creation. Kay. Do you remember?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I think... it was 33 pounds <thought>33 lbs (15 Kg</thought> weights - Metal weights. Placed near the well. Each one weighs 33 pounds <thought>15 Kg</thought>.). I wonder what such a heavy thing was used for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It doesn't seem to be directly related to the circus.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">These things around the well <thought>Tools around the well - Pulleys, metal weights and ropes. What could they be used for?</thought>, what were they used for? They don't seem to be related to the Animal Show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I agree. We can ask Ms. Berry about it later.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This pulley was used to lift the bucket from the well. The bucket... can't be found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This door is locked.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Want me to pick the lock? Success is not guaranteed though!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, if need be I'll just borrow a key.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sheesh. I thought it was finally a chance for me to steal the spotlight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't even think about stealing anything in my presence... Not even the spotlight.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">A Great Thief's secret weapon. ...He he, I see. But, isn't this bad? Using a thief's tool to aid in the investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Don't make such a scary face. It's alright, Uncle Ray's lips are sealed. ...It's for the truth, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The evidence may very well already have been destroyed. In order to re-create the crime scene, we need her help.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Why so serious? At times like this, a simple smile will suffice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This crate... No, there are tires attached to it, so I guess it's a cart.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Just once, I'd like to ride one of these bad boys down a hill.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Or maybe one of those office chairs with wheels, doesn't that sound like fun?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...What is she talking about?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Umm. What was the elephant's name again?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">She's Astique the Asian Elephant <thought>Astique the elephant - Star of the show. Along with Regent the tiget and Simon.</thought>!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ahh. That's right. It's an easy name to remember.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Maybe... they couldn't think of a good name, so they gave her a name that's easy to remember?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! What a terrible thing to say about poor Astique!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This pond is where Warden Roland keeps her pet alligator.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess those fish bones are the remains of her last meal...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think an alligator would leave such clean bones.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But she had a very refined-looking face.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I couldn't tell at all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's because I'm a girl who's good with faces.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Why don't I feel the least bit jealous?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What an impressive barbed wire fence! It really gets my thief's blood boiling.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wouldn't touch it though. You'll be in for quite a shock.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder what's on the other side of the fence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Looks like the warden's office.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I heard she keeps even more animals over there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why don't they just turn this place into a zoo already?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's all the information we can gather for now. The detective should be here soon too. Kay, go ahead and shut down Little Thief.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright! Returning the area to normal!</line>
<line speaker="???">Sorry to keep you waiting, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, speak of the Gummy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. That was quick.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I couldn't keep you waiting for too long, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thanks for coming along too, Regina!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">No problem! It sounded like fun, so I skipped practice to come here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you for your cooperation. First, Detective, let's have Missile do some tracking.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No problem, sir! Hey, Missile! Over here, pal! Hey, what's eating you, pal? I said over here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like he's scared of something, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A-A-A-A-A-A! A-Alligator!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I guess he's scared of the alligator, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good grief. Looks like Missile won't be much help to us.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So what should we do, Miles?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Maybe we can ask Ms. Berry for help.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">What is it? What is it? Is there something I can do? Do you want me to teach Ally a trick?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Actually, she probably could.</thought> No, I just need you to tell me about the condition of the courtyard during the show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like it's my time to shine again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright, that should do it! I'm starting up the re-creation now!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Re-creation complete! This time you can see how the courtyard was during the Animal Show!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This should be around the time the body was dropped down the well.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Wow, cool! It's just like magic!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He he he, it's not magic. I just re-created the scene based on the information you gave us. See? Look over there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? The backstage area is missing...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, Regina didn't help with the preparations, so... She doesn't really know how it was set up.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I get it. You can't re-create what you don't have the info for, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">I'm sorry. It's because Simon took care of setting everything up...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Don't worry yourself none, Regina-pie. Miles is the one as fault here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why me...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! I've re-created the show in progress... But I can also change it to how it was earlier, when it was being taken down!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So we can examine the courtyard during the show and after the show... We can freely switch between the two different states. <thought>To change the re-creation, select Little Thief on the bottom screen.</thought> Now, let's begin the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The apples in the crate were probably eaten by Astique...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">But it's strange. I remember leaving the crate out of reach from Astique's nose.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you certain?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes. The crate was still full of apples on the night before the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, the cart was moved to where her nose could reach it. With that many apples, it could not have been moved by the wind. Most likely... the crate was moved by a person <thought>Crate of apples - Somebody moved the crate of apples on the night before the show.</thought>. Prior to the show, the cart's position was already changed and the apples were all eaten. This appears to be the correct information. Please update the simulation parameters, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright, I'll use the new info to re-create the scene! </line>
<line speaker="Kay">First, let's return to the "During the Show" scene!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Using the info we got from Regina, I'll re-create the scene with the cart in its actual place!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Re-creation complete!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You want to re-create the After the Show scene from yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The After the Show scene from yesterday has been re-created!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You want to re-create the During the Show scene from two days ago?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The During the Show scene from two days ago has been re-created!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Do you still remember how the Little Thief works?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I can basically examine its re-creation like I normally do in my investigations.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes! If something catches your eye, please examine it to your heart's content! Oh, but if there's an error with the info, the re-creation could come out a bit strange, alright? If you find anything strange, please present some evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm still not used to the new feature of the Little Thief...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Using the latest feature, we can re-create the same spot at different times! By the way, we can currently re-create... ...the "During the Show" from two days ago, and the "After the Show" from yesterday!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>When I want to investigate a different scene, I'll ask her to Change Re-creation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Do you come here often, Regina?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yes. I have many friends here. I love this place! New friends, old friends, everyone's a friend here. Yesterday, Ms. Warden introduced me to a new friend, little Ally.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The alligator who lurks in the pond in the courtyard...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">That pond... If you get too close, it feels like you'll get "gulped".</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Umm. I don't think little Ally would do such a thing. Her stomach wasn't feeling very well yesterday. I'm worried. Aren't you all worried too? ...Right?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Yes! Of course! We're all worried, right? Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... Urk. <thought>Don't drag me into this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! You've got that look on your face, like you want to use my secret weapons, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Missile isn't in the mood, but I've got my fishing rod ready to go! Or would you prefer the metal detector <thought>Metal detector - One of Gumshoe's Seven Secret Weapons! Can detect metal objects.</thought>?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I've never seen the detective's eyes sparkle like that.</thought> If need be, I'll let you know. For now, just stand by.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At this point in time, we still don't have enough information about this area.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Please steal some information!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't steal information. I obtain it through my investigation and logic.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I prefer to act first before thinking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may act before thinking as long as you don't interfere with the investigation. I wouldn't want to arrest you.</line>
<line speaker="Missile">...*whimper*...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">As you can see, he's totally scared, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wanted him to track a scent, but it looks like that won't be possible.</line>
<line speaker="Missile">...*whimper*...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These chairs are lined up in an orderly fashion. <thought>I guess there were a few empty seats during the performance...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This intimate atmosphere... And this closeness between the stage and the audience. It reminds me of the karaoke tournament I entered when I was a kid.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Karaoke tournament?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I was the runner-up! ♬ Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! ♪ ♬ Now, listen to the song of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! ♪</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't tell me, you actually sang that song?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Of course, this song rocks!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm surprised she actually made it to the finals. ...Did she steal second place? No. If she didn't steal first place, she must have gotten there fair and square...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">A love story between an elephant and a tiger... I really wanted to see that. I also wanted to see Simon in action!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon is really amazing! Especially the part where he gets blown away.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blown away... That's the scene in question.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">At that point, the suspect, in the role of the villain... ...is blown away by the heroine's burning love, and makes his exit. After being blown away, the suspect disappeared from the stage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you saying the crime was committed during that time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you know how long he was gone from the stage?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Let me think. About 15 minutes or so.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's just as Judge Courtney said...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">But... isn't it dangerous? To be blown away by an elephant?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">It's alright! Astique is very gentle!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not who we're worried about here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">During the first few practices, he was having trouble getting blown away... Then all of a sudden, he was able to be sent flying beautifully. He might be using some sort of device, but it's amazing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A device...? Do you know anything about it?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Umm. I have no idea. Simon handled it all by himself <thought>Simon's stunt - The scene where Astique knocks Simon into the air employs some kind of trick.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? This crate was empty in the re-creation earlier...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right... It was also empty in the picture I took.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah. I'm sorry. That information is wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">This crate contained Astique's food... In the morning on the day of the show, all the apples were gone. I totally forgot about that. ...I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Missing apples (Missing apples - Astique's feed. Was there the day before the show, was gone the next morning.</thought>, huh. I should make a note of it.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No wonder I thought it smelled like animals, it contained the elephant's food.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So this was filled with Astique's apples.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">That's right. On the day before the show, it was full of apples!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And in the morning, they were all gone...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! Did you think of something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You could say that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the cage of the Asian elephant... Astique. The elephant is performing on stage right now, so the cage is empty.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder how Astique entered the courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean how?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The entrance here is human-sized! And this fence is electrified... I don't think an elephant would enter from there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...They could just turn off the electricity.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If they did that, all the inmates would escape!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I doubt anyone would escape while an elephant was entering.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. I wonder how she came in. This requires some thought!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...She seems to be enjoying her little brain teaser. I should just let her be.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes used a device for his stunt... Maybe the tools around the well are connected to this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. I'd like to recheck the tools lying around the well yesterday. Can you change the re-creation to the After the Show scene?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Roger!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The tools lying around the well. Could they have been a part of his device?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It seems very likely! I wonder if it's possible to re-create the device?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you ask Mr. Keyes, he should be able to tell you how the device was put together.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright! I'll go ask him!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! I asked him about it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And, did you find out how the device works?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He used a rope to hang some weights on the well's pulley... The weights were suspended inside the well. Then, he ran the rope through two more pulleys... ...and tied the end of the rope to his own body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So he uses the force of the falling weights to send himself flying. But, what's to stop the weights from falling on their own?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">In order to prevent that from happening, he used a stopper!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Berry didn't know anything about the well. That means... ...Mr. Keyes removed the stopper by himself?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Correct! That's why a second rope was needed. This rope was attached to the stopper, and when it was pulled from the stage...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The stopper would be removed, and the weights would drop down the well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm definitely going to steal this idea! The Yatagarasu won't lose to something like this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't waste your time. Circus acts require extensive training. Even if you steal the device, it won't do you any good.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, I'll train as well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Before you start training, could you first update the re-creation?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah. Oh yeah, you wanted me to re-create the device that was used in the performance. First, let's return to the During the Show scene! Next, I'll input the information of the device on the well! Now we can re-create the device Simon made!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, this is the device that Mr. Keyes used.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon sure is gutsier than he looks. Using the falling weights... as the force to launch himself during his performance...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. He would have to drop enough weights to exceed his own body weight. In order to provide the strength needed to pull him off the stage <thought>Strength to be pulled - In order for the stunt to work, the weights must exceed Simon's weight.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon must have practiced a lot for this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Seeing a well gets me excited for some reason. There could be secret trapdoors or ghosts down there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">More importantly, what do you think about the device on the well?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A well with a secret device... I'm getting even more excited!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....Good for you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This sheet... It's the same as the one from the workroom...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Isn't this the same as the one from the workroom?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. <thought>Why is there also one here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder why there's one here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, are you deep in thought?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why does it feel like she's stealing my thoughts...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes used this well to perform the stunt where he gets blown away by the elephant. He used those two ropes quite skillfully.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looking at this weight, you can really feel the weight of Simon's hard work on your chest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Is that so? I don't feel anything at all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww, that's too bad. If this was an actual weight... ...I'd immediately put it on your chest, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...And I'd do everything in my power to stop you.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This rope dangles into the well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I doubt a piñata is on the other end of the rope, nor is it candy, obviously...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Take this more seriously.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">C'mon, Mr. Edgeworth. It was a joke, a joke! Please don't take everything so seriously.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No. Wait... What's on the other end of the rope... This could be worth thinking over.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A rope and pulley. That's how it should be.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A rope and pulley. A thief and treasure. It's a perfect match!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Objection. A thief and handcuffs are a perfect match.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Isn't this strange?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's wrong, pal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Haven't you noticed, Detective? What's strange about the weight is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's strange is the number of weights... In other words...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's strange about the weight is the material it's made of.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's wrong with the material it's made of, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... So you still don't get it, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I have absolutely not clue, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I don't get it either!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know either...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Please be more serious!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mm... Mmph. <thought>Let me think this over again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">So... What's so strange, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...it's not heavy enough <thought>Not heavy enough - In order to lift Simon's body, more weights are required.</thought>. In order to pull up Mr. Keyes' body weight...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-You're right, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But... Where did the rest of the weights disappear to?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Looks like it's time to use my Seven Secret Weapons, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... If necessary, I'll let the detective know...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. It's time for your secret weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I was hoping for the metal detector.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I don't get many chances to use this one...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Before we begin the search, let me go over how to use the metal detector, sir! This metal detector uses sound... ...and this meter... ...to let you know how close you are to a metal object! When you get closer to a metal object... ...the metal detector will have a bigger reaction, like this. When you get the biggest reaction... ...give me the order to Examine that spot, sir! Now, let's see what we've got? ...It's just the metal fence... And that's basically how you search for metal objects. Just give me the instructions on where you want to search, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Let me explain how to use the metal detector, sir! The sound and the meter will let you know how close you are to the metal objects... That's how this metal detector works, sir! The closer you are to a metal object, the bigger the reaction will be. When you get the biggest reaction, make sure to Examine it! I'll handle the searching part, so just give me the instructions, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe! Enough with the idle chatter and continue the investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oooh... Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Here, sir! It looks like there's something here! Oooooh...! It's a gold coin, sir! It's a historical discovery!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's hardly possible that something like this could find its way into a prison.</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Ah, there it is! So that's where it was buried! That's a coin from the bi-weekly coin hunting competition!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">There's an event like that? That sure sounds like fun, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">It's an event where the warden buries some coins and the prisoners search for them... There are 3 silver coins and 1 gold coin. Whoever finds them can trade them in for snacks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A coin hunting competition and an Animal Show... Just what kind of prison is this, anyway?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Let's continue the search, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Here, sir! It looks like there's something here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't see anything that could be metallic... What could be causing the reaction?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hmm... Maybe there are iron filings around here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Iron filings, like the ones you collect with a magnet?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir. I guess they're mixed into the sand here. If we're going to pull them out, we'll need Secret Weapon No. 6! ...Or was it 7?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Can't you even keep that much straight?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's just a regular magnet I bought at the hardware store! Hold it near the ground and... Presto! Picked them all up, sir! Wow... This is really... Ha ha ha... Well, whaddya know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Finding simple joy in simple tasks... What a simpleton. Let's check somewhere else.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Let's continue the search, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No reaction, sir. Seems a little discouraging, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I think we're getting warmer, but the reaction's still kind of weak, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">We're getting close, sir! There should be something metal nearby!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah! There's a reaction here, too, sir! Let's check it out... Huh? I found these in the clumps of grass here, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These are the weights used for that hoisting device! <thought>Were these intentionally hidden...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">There's four of them in all, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That many weights would be enough to lift Simon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, the other weights that were used in the device were hidden. <thought>Why were they hidden over here, though?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">See? I'm really earning my keep today, aren't I, sir? Eeeeeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! The alligator!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Th-That scared me, pal... Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's the matter, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really! Why?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you sure it isn't still just reacting to the weights?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's a different reaction, sir! And it's definitely coming from the alligator!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's gone...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like it's scared of us!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Hmm... I don't think so, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">If anything, I think Ally looks a little under the weather.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ally... I suppose that was what Warden Roland called it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">She didn't eat any of the food that the warden gave her yesterday... I think she might have eaten something bad.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">So I guess the metal detector could be reacting to whatever the alligator ate.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! Maybe she ate one of the weights?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I doubt that even an alligator can ingest a 33 pound weight. <thought>But what could the metal detector be reaction to? And regardless, why were these weights hidden? Hmm, maybe we should take another look at the device on the well.</thought> Kay, I'd like you to re-create the After the Show scene again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright! Leave it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! I just had an epiphany, sir! The killer is... Eureka! The Invisible Man!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Somehow, the killer brought in a murder weapon and moved the body, and nobody noticed. If the Invisible Man was the killer, it would explain how all of this was possible!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective. You can't be serious about that.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'm not totally sure, but... It'd be neat if it were true!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Starting tomorrow, you're pairing up with Mr. Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eeehh! No way, sir! Not with that goofy prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He'd be a perfect match for this goofy detective.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes used this well to perform the stunt where he gets blown away by the elephant. He used those two ropes quite skillfully. Hm? Two ropes? In the After the Show scene... I should use the Little Thief's new function and change the re-creation to double check...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This rope... was part of the device used during the show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">To be able to create a device with just one piece of rope... Simon is surprisingly handy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hm? <thought>One piece of rope...? It seems that there is a contradiction with the device...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence shows the contradiction with the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Could you be more precise about where the contradiction is?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'd also like to hear you explain it in more detail, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... Around here somewhere...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Please be more specific, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mm... Mmph! <thought>This device... It could be just me. But it feels like something is missing...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This re-creation and the device we saw earlier... There is a major discrepancy. One of the ropes is missing!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Without it, the device won't work.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder what happened to it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Where did the missing rope disappear to...?</thought> It's possible that we hold the piece of evidence that shows where the rope went.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Which piece of evidence shows where the missing rope went?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Does that show where the missing rope went, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, where's the missing rope!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! Why aren't you saying anything?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah! <thought>It seems I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Speaking of ropes, didn't we see one somewhere?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I remember seeing one too, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, Mr. Edgeworth. Which piece of evidence shows where the missing rope went?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The rope we found with the dead body...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Could it be...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It could be the other piece of rope that was used here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, does that mean!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This rope was attached to the weight! However, the weight was not one of these metal weights. These weights were hidden in the grass and replaced with something else.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If they were replaced, then what was used as the weight?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was tied to the rope we found in the workroom... If we can recall that, then the answer should be clear! The weight that was dropped in place of the weights that Mr. Keyes had prepared was...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was the weight that was used in the device!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sorry to interrupt while you're brimming with confidence, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Could that really be used as a replacement?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngah! <thought>Was I mistaken... What did we find alongside the missing rope? I must try and recall it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">So what was used as the weight, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What dropped down the well... was none other than Knightley's dead body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">EHHH! Mr. Knightley's body was used as the weight?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, the weights were replaced with Knightley's body. Mr. Keyes used the device to launch himself off the stage... When the rope that was tied to him was undone and let go... ...both the body and the rope dropped down the well... The rope wasn't used to tie up Knightley. It was used to suspend him inside the well. That also explains why the other weights were hidden.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! So that no one would find out that the weights were replaced with the body!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. The killer was the one who hid those weights.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But, Miles. Wasn't Knightley-boy stabbed in the neck with the murder weapon? If he was suspended in the well, wouldn't there be blood at the bottom of the well?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The killer was also aware of that. That's why they used this item. <thought>Which item did the killer use in order to leave no traces of blood behind?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Umm, Uncle Ray doesn't quite follow. If he used that, how would it prevent the blood from falling?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you get it, Mr. Shields? If it were used like this...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles. That's not possible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah! <thought>This isn't the right one... A tool to prevent the blood from falling... Was there anything like that near the dead body?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The sheet we found near the body. It was used to wrap up the body.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see! It looks like all the pieces are starting to come together, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But... this means that the body definitely came from the well. If that's the case, wouldn't that mean Simon is the killer...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... that's not necessarily the case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh!? But! Yesterday, Judge Courtney said!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Mr. Keyes was the killer, would he have needed to set up such an elaborate device?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess you have a point...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes was only responsible for dropping the body during the show... In other words, it doesn't matter where the real killer was or what they were doing during the show. Until now, this placed the doubt on the people who did not watch the Animal Show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-It's true, we also suspected Mr. Dogen...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The killer's true intent was to make us think that the murder occurred during the show. In other words, they used the device on the well to create a fake alibi! Ms. Berry. Do you know when this device on the well was set up?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Umm, let me think. The day before the show. I think it was at night. We all started preparing at 9 PM. We finished at around midnight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The killer replaced the weights with the dead body <thought>Weights switched with body - The device was set up with the body on the night before the show.</thought> afterwards.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Did Dogen know about the device...? No, even if he knew about the device, it wouldn't be possible for him to use it. You can't teach a dog to suspend a body in a well. In other words... Dogen is not the killer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This cart was moved the night before the show. The body was also switched the night before the show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I don't think it was just a coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Keeping that in mind, the question now becomes... Why was the cart moved? The cart used to be in front of that door. I can think of one reason why.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Somebody opened that door! Alright, let's hurry up and... The door's locked. Let's ask a guard! Hey! Mr. Guard!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Yes! What is it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was fast...</thought> You there. Where's the key to this door?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">The warden's in charge of it! I'll get it from her right away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The warden is in charge of the keys here...? Without the warden's permission, this door can't be opened.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thank you very much!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a circuit breaker panel... This must be the breaker room.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">On the night before the show, somebody came into this room. I wonder why they would come here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think anyone would confuse the breaker room with the break room. It was definitely to operate the circuit breakers...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm. So someone came here to shut off the power to something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was there anything... that had its power shut off? What could have had its power shut off by the breaker...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. If this had been powered off, it would have caused a huge problem.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A huge problem? Umm. I don't see any problems...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Cast aside your preconceptions. Try thinking with an open mind. In doing so, you will see an answer that exceeds your wildest imagination!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I'm not seeing anything. At all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ugh! <thought>It seems I was mistaken... When the breaker tripped, the electrical equipment would have lost power... Is there any evidence that can prove this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The security camera footage had a three hour gap.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! I see! The circuit breaker for the security camera was tripped!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's highly possible.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Was this the killer's handiwork?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">With the camera down, it'd be easier to move about. The killer would have a major advantage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knew it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If that's the case... The killer was the person who tripped the breaker...! The person in charge of the key to the breaker room is... It couldn't be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Deactivating the re-creation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I'm first to the scene, as always!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Good morning, Mr. Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha-! You! How did you get here before me?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Greetings, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I see you have arrived early.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Or maybe it is you who are late, Judge Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I have many matters which require my attention... I have no time to waste. Unlike a certain prosecutor who was taken off the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Grr...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Oh, my apologies. I had forgotten that you were assisting the defense attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">An assistant can never be the best! You've fallen like the rest!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You just say whatever you like, don't you...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Let us begin our examination of the courtyard, Sebastian.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Alright! I'll call the men over.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That will be unnecessary.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We have already finished the investigation of the courtyard. You've been bested.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Bested... Me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Your reasoning from yesterday... Watch me shatter it to pieces.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........ I would advise you to choose your words more carefully. Have you forgotten that the fate of your badge rests in my hands?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have had enough of such coercion. Can't you think of some other way to threaten me that does not involve my badge?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Despite my repeated warnings, you show no signs of reflection... It seems I must remind you once more. The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee can't leave someone such as yourself unchecked.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Neither the fate of my badge nor the actions of the Committee will impede my progress. Proving Mr. Keyes' innocence... That is all that concerns me.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Your words are like those of a defense attorney. If you are willing to go that far, then I will show no leniency. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I shall turn your words against you. And at that moment... You will forfeit the title of "Prosecutor". You shall regret this...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I shared my reasoning with you the day before.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Naturally, you have evidence to support your reasoning?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Of course she does! Who do you think she is!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Earlier, I received the official autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Babysitting that kid must be difficult.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The time of death was the night before the body was discovered... In other words, the day before the show. The cause of death remains unchanged, a stab wound four inches deep.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Simon Keyes was not present on the stage for a period of 15 minutes. There was sufficient time for him to drop the body down the well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She has not investigated the courtyard yet. That means...</thought> Hm. It seems there is a hole in your argument.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You seem quite confident. ...Can you present evidence to support your claim?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course I can, and I will.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I shared my reasoning with you the day before.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you continue to believe Mr. Keyes is the murderer?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Just as you continue to speak as if he is not. Do you have any decisive evidence? Do you know the identity of the true criminal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You do realize you need proper evidence, too.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am a representative of the Goddess of Law. My words are her holy orders. Indeed... If I state something is black, it is black. If I state something is white, it is white!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So what would you call gray?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If you wish to disprove my words, then present your evidence at once!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Since Mr. Elbird did not see the body when he passed through the tunnel...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Couldn't it be possible that Elbird just failed to notice the body?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Assistant's Assistant, did you also enter the hole?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? How'd you know?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I noticed that there was some mud stuck on your lovely hair ornament yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's amazing! Your powers of observation would even put a Great Thief to shame!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In the name of the Goddess of Law, answer me truthfully. If there were a dead body in that tunnel, would it have escaped your notice?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">W-Well, the thing is... Um... Yeah, I think I would've noticed something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do you understand now? Mr. Elbird did not see the body.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It could only have been dropped down the well during the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body was dropped down the well during the show? I'd like to hear your reasoning for this.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The day before the show, Mr. Elbird lent the key to Mr. Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The key to Knightley's cell, huh...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Knightley escaped from his cell with the key and entered the cage Mr. Keyes had prepared. Mr. Keyes then moved the cage to the courtyard, and proceeded to murder Mr. Knightley. The next day, when Mr. Elbird passed through the tunnel, he did not come across the body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Please wait a minute! That doesn't seem right at all! Wasn't there a sweet smell in the tunnel? Mr. Knightley must have passed through it!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Knightley passed through the tunnel after Mr. Elbird did. Mr. Elbird passed through the tunnel at the start of the show. However, the body wasn't found until the end of the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which is why you believe the body was dropped during the show.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. And there is only one person who could have carried out this act.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The only one who could have performed such an act is the suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is no one else who could have committed the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I heard that Ms. Berry was present on stage at all times. A great number of the prisoners were also watching the show. Even the prisoners who did not see it have sufficient alibis.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How about the guards?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Along with the warden, nearly everyone was watching the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But there must have been a chance for even one of them to approach the well.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">During the show, none of the guards left their posts. That much is certain. They all testified as such.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ugh... She's left no room for oversight...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do you finally admit that only Simon Keyes could have been the criminal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney has not thoroughly examined the courtyard like we have.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So there's a bit of a gap in her argument, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should review the evidence we obtained in the courtyard.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately for you, Judge Courtney, your argument doesn't hold any water, just like the well. There was a device set up around the well here.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What is this device of which you speak?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you aware of the stunt in which Mr. Keyes is blown away by the elephant during the show?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I have heard of it. It would have been right before he exits the stage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He tied one end of a length of rope to himself, and the other end to a set of weights... He was able to perform the stunt by dropping these weights down the well.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wouldn't he have spent the whole play suspended up in the air?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's why he had a stopper attached to the weighted end. The stopper was removed by pulling another rope. Around the well, we found evidence that the weights were switched with the victim's body. This was done by the real killer in order to shift suspicion away from them!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judging from the time of death, the murder was carried out in the early morning of the show. The true criminal had until the time the show started to set up the device.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But didn't Simon Keyes made that thing? And since he was also the one who used it, he is "the best" suspect... Don't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Mr. Keyes were the murderer, he would not have needed to do that! Ms. Berry!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was there anyone else who knew of the device he set up?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Well, let me see... Since we had to get everything about our show approved by the people here at the prison... I'd say there were others who knew about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And there you have it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see... You have indeed performed a thorough investigation. Which is why I am even further perplexed. Why do you not use your efforts for justice?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">My actions are not just? Who made that decision?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You cannot understand even that? Even now? Providing support to a defense attorney, despite being a prosecutor... Is it quite unnatural. This goes against the rules.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am merely choosing to do what I think is right at this particular time. I travel down the road I have chosen. Your comprehension does not matter in the least. However, if anyone intends to interfere... I will show no mercy!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Perhaps this is a calling from the Goddess of Law. If you intend to rebel against her divine will... I will have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Pay heed to my words. I have one more reason to suspect Simon Keyes of murder.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If the body came from the courtyard...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">While Simon Keyes was moving supplies for the show, he visited Mr. Knightley's cell. Does that not strike you as odd? Why else would he have brought a large, covered cage with him?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ohh... That does seem pretty suspicious...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes... Was merely that kind of person. It is entirely possible that he carelessly brought it there!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If that is possible... Then it is also possible that he was assisting in the escape. Am I wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... I suppose I must refute her theory with evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If the body came from the courtyard...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You seem to believe that Knightley was killed in the courtyard... So, can you say when he was brought here?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">On the day of the show between midnight and 8 AM. I am positive it could only have been during that time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So after rehearsal had ended and before the show began.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The most pressing issue is...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">How was Mr. Knightley brought here from the detention center?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you certain there were no other routes?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">A trial date had not yet been determined for Mr. Knightley. Since he was not a prisoner, he could not have easily entered the prison. He would have stood out too much.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Meaning no one testified seeing him there.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well done! May you be blessed by the Goddess of Law! As I said, Mr. Knightley was taken into the prison through a less conspicuous manner.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Only Simon Keyes could have provided such an opportunity.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you certain that he was the only person who had the opportunity?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Have you forgotten? This is a prison. Due to the constant supervision, it would be impossible to do anything unusual.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, wouldn't it be the same for Mr. Keyes?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The warden has shown favor to the Berry Big Circus. Simon Keyes is a circus member. Ms. Berry's apprentice, no less. ...It could only have been him. He was able to move about freely within the facility.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems that you forgot to mention that.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The word "forget" does not exist in my dictionary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, it would be prudent for you to add this to your argument. Mr. Keyes may have been the only person who could move around freely in the prison... But on the day of the murder, there was a gap in time missing from the surveillance records. During that time, anyone could have done as they pleased! <thought>Do I have proof of this gap in the surveillance records?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Here is the evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...What do you think, Sebastian?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hmm, lemme think here... Since all humans have two legs... Anyone could have walked around the place!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">However, to walk around a prison freely is...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Not gonna be that easy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>E-Even Debeste pointed out my mistake...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wa ha ha! Seems you learn quickly, Hedgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Who are you calling "Hedgeworth"!? Her claim is based on the prison's surveillance system. I just need to present evidence that will make it seem less reliable...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Because of this fact, I find it most difficult to suspect any other party of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No other suspects...? Are you serious?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If I had to say... Ms. Berry also seems suspicious.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Umm... but I didn't do anything like that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">R-Regina... You do know you are being suspected of murder, right?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yeah, but I didn't do it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It would take much more than that to scare a wild animal tamer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmhm... I know you did not. It was merely a jest.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Oh, really? That's what I figured.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These two don't look jovial in the least.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mr. Keyes was not the only one with the opportunity. If I can prove that with evidence, I can break this deadlock!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes wasn't the only one who had the opportunity!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Who else could have had the opportunity?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The timestamp on the security camera is off by three hours. This means there was a three hour gap in time. During that time, anyone could have done it!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If that were the case, then the murderer would have created the gap in time intentionally. It would not have been a simple camera failure. Are you saying that is possible?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible, if you had access to this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So with that, they could have created the gap in time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. With this, it would be possible...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Out of the question.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How can you say that!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Then please demonstrate how it is possible for myself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>That would be impossible... If the cameras were stopped, it would be possible to create a gap in the recording. I should know how it was done!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So, it would be impossible to intentionally create this gap in time, am I right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're wrong, Judge Courtney!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In this courtyard, we found... The circuit breaker for the security camera. And it was possible to access the breaker room both before and after the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...... ...Unfortunately, it appears that you have fallen short of your intentions.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth hasn't fallen short of anything!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmhmm. So, can you explain how the murderer obtained the key to the breaker room?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh yeah, that's right. It was locked, wasn't it? The warden hangs onto the key, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The breaker room has great importance even in a prison. There is no one who would be able to obtain the key so easily.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I can think of someone.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Wh-What did you say...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This person... the murderer, was able to get the key. They didn't even need to steal it.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">There can't be anyone like that! Besides, the breaker to the electrified fence is in that room, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Only one person could have done this. I didn't want to believe it myself, but I trust that my logic is sound!</thought> The person who used the key to enter the breaker room is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What? That person had the key?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it could only have been them.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Edgeworth, please cease this careless talk. How was this person able to obtain the key?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urk... Hrmmm... <thought>I suppose it wasn't this person... I need to remember who normally holds on to this key. That person should immediately come to mind.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">See, it's just like I said earlier! There's no one who could have gotten their hands on that key!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Mr. Debeste. There is just one person who could have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The murderer is... Warden Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh my, what an energetic little puppy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's because this dog is extremely fond of sweets. It seems to detect a sweet scent on you.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh, heavens no. I'm not even wearing perfume or anything of the sort.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What the dog detects is the sweet scent of death...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">How poetic! However, does that not imply that I committed a murder?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's what I think.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-What?!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The warden is... the murderer? Mr. Edgeworth, are you serious about your statement?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh ho ho, how amusing. The very thought of a warden committing a murder. It sounds like something out of a mystery novel!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Precisely. Your reasoning is in contempt!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nothing of the sort. I did not want to believe it myself, but... Based on the evidence, I have no choice but to believe it. This evidence proves that Warden Roland is the murderer...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This proves you are the murderer.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Treating me like a criminal just because of that is so cruel! That doesn't even have anything to do with me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>That wasn't it. Missile's reaction to Warden Roland earlier... What was the cause of it...? I need to let that guide me to the answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">I suppose your accusation was nothing more than a joke in poor taste after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, it was not, Warden Roland! You are the murderer!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Then why don't you show us the evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The smell gave you away. As you can plainly see, someone has taken notice.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This police dog...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He tracked a sweet smell that came from the body. And right now, he is telling us that the same scent is also on Warden Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Hu hu hu! You're a cruel one to accuse me of murder based on something like that! Right, Justine-darling?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that Judge Courtney has reached the same conclusion as I have.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Mr. Edgeworth, this couldn't have been just a coincidence, could it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The key to the breaker room and the same scent on the body... If it were only one, it could have been seen as such.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It appears... we have reached a conclusion. We should now listen to what the warden has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Until we do... ...we cannot close this case!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh my goodness. Everyone with such scary faces. So I'm the only one who could have been the murderer? That just cannot be...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I heard all about the case from Justine-darling here.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I don't know what reasoning you had, but I can say for sure... ...I cannot be the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But Missile barked at you, pal! You've gotta be the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh heavens, it's not possible... I already told you, I never went to the prison. If you think I'm lying, why don't you check the records.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She wants us to check the records? She does seem confident. For now, all we can do is listen to her and try to draw out more information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">I do hope you understand, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I heard all about the case from Justine-darling here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From Judge Courtney? Are you two... close?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">As close as fish and water. Are you jealous?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">J... J-Jealous...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">On the first day of the investigation, she filled us in on the situation. In exchange for our cooperation, she explained the details of the case to us.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">How could you say that! You're so mean, Justine-darling!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmhmm. The truth is the truth. I believe it should be told as such.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>F-For some reason... Those two seem kind of... Scary...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Had I committed the murder, it would've taken place inside the holding cell.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The murder occurred inside the cell? How can you be so certain about that?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well, everywhere else would be under surveillance, right? And the victim's blood was found there too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That blood was actually from when he was struck by Elbird, but... ...I don't think it's necessary to inform her of this fact.</thought> That doesn't mean it's proven, you do know that?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">But I see no contradictions in assuming the crime scene was at the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">But I couldn't have moved the body. I never went into the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You never went into the prison? Do you have proof of this?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">My, my. Can't you wait for me to finish?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I was caught up in my work. Up until the show, I was stuck in my office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were in your office the whole time...? Nothing strange happened?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Nope, nothing at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Were you looking for something?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I'm not too good at tidying up. I always forget where I put everything... The other day, I even lost track of an important piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>H-How could you have made such a grave error!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">If someone were to take something from me, I wouldn't even notice it the entire year.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... I guess it will be hard to attack with the key to the breaker room.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">On the day of the incident, I was working in my office, and searching for lost items. In other words, I couldn't have gone to the prison, even if I had wanted to.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Check up on it if you like. You'll find there's no record of me entering the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You did not enter the prison from the entrance. But, what if there was another route?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh my, are you suggesting something like a secret passage? I don't know if anything like that exists.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is my firm belief you did possess an alternate route. That route was neither the entrance nor a secret passage... The route you used was from here...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You moved through here to enter the prison!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh my. Now how would I have got to the prison from there? Mr. Edgeworth, you yourself said that I used neither the entrance nor a secret passage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>This wasn't the right route... To get to the prison from the warden's office without using the entrance or tunnel... The only way possible is by going through that place!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Knightley was suspended from the well the night before the show...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-What should we do, sir! This lady's got nerves of steel!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... But there's no record of her going to the prison, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The records won't help us at the present time. First, let's listen carefully and gather information.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The barbed wire fence...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You would have moved Knightley to your office first. This office leads directly to the garden side of the courtyard. If you had moved through here, and passed the barbed wire fence... ...you would have arrived at the prison without passing through the entrance or a tunnel!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Hu hu hu! I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth is saying? Haven't you noticed? There's a high-voltage current running through the fence...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Yeah! Obviously she couldn't have passed through it like that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The current to the fence could be switched off at the breaker room. And you were the only one who had the key, Warden Roland!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Most amusing. However, the breaker room is located on the prison side of the courtyard. How would the warden have accessed it from the detention center?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...Ah, quite right. Gotcha there, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh. That's...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If there is no record of her passing through the prison entrance... ...it would not have been possible for her to turn off the fence's breaker.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...! But, Warden Roland was the only one who had access...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Don't let this faze you, Miles.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, if I don't have a solution for this, she'll get away!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now, Uncle Ray never said, "don't think", you know... It's just not good to be so stubborn about it. That's all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>But, no matter how you think about it, Warden Roland couldn't have done this alone. Hm...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, if you have failed to come up with a new poss...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am not amused. Interrupting my judgement only to be silent.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Without thinking, I just blurted out ><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> My reasoning... is not over yet.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So, how did she use the breaker without leaving the detention center?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's perfectly possible. With this method...! <thought>What made it possible to turn off the breaker...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Her position as the warden made it possible!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">So I was able to use the breaker from the detention center, because I am the warden? In that case, I'd have to be not just a warden, but a psychic as well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph! <thought>That wasn't right... It would be difficult for Warden Roland to use the breaker alone... Which means!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It was indeed impossible for the warden to have used the breaker.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, there was one way she could have done it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The timing of the incident made it possible!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The timing of the incident tripped the breaker?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So, just how was the breaker tripped?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">As I thought, you have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nph! <thought>It wasn't that... It would be difficult for Warden Roland to use the breaker alone... Which means!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It was indeed impossible for the warden to have used the breaker.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, there was one way she could have done it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was indeed impossible for one person. But what if... there were two?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Exactly! Just what I expected from you, Miles!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... You had an accomplice on the prison side!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Enough. I am disappointed in you, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's that, pal!? You making fun of Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...The inmates at this prison all wear bracelets.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If they try and go where they please, they will set off the alarm... Aah!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So you've noticed. This is a prison after all. Not only the prisoners, but the guards too, are under constant scrutiny.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So why didn't everyone notice Elbird...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The only ones allowed to move around freely are the animals... ...and they certainly could not have used the breaker.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, it's still possible that a person did it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Excluding the inmates and the guards, just what kind of person would you say it was?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We can't exclude the inmates and guards just yet! There was only one person. One whose movement was not restricted. This evidence shows that there was someone in the prison who could move around freely!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This evidence points to the existence of that person.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, I'd like you to explain just who this points to.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, why aren't you saying anything?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems he doesn't know, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>She saw through me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Someone whose movement wasn't restricted... Wasn't there someone who tried to hide that from us?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. And we must find the evidence that implicates them!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It would seem that the warden's supposed accomplice does not exist after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Judge Courtney. There remains one person.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That is...? It looks like the bracelet worn by the prisoners.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This belongs to a certain "model inmate". ...And it's broken.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What... Just who on earth does this belong to!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Frank Sahwit. The warden's favorite inmate.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you think it's strange? He managed to keep this hidden while he moved around freely in his daily prison life.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Golly. When you think about it, it shouldn't be possible.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">.......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd hazard a guess that this was because he was a special case. Just like Sirhan Dogen in the special cell...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The prosecutor's statement is mere conjecture!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. You could find out by simply asking Sahwit himself. It is my firm belief that Mr. Sahwit and Warden Roland were partners in crime! Due to their collaboration, another route surfaces. The real route by which Knightley's body was moved to the prison! There were two obstacles that needed to be dealt with. The security camera in front of Knightley's cell. And, the electric fence in the courtyard. Both these problems could have been solved with a single stroke. By having Sahwit switch off the breakers in the breaker room!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Mr. Edgeworth. Could you wait one moment?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you still intend to deny it, Warden Roland?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">*sigh*... I give in. I confess.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Warden Roland... No! This cannot be!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes, it's just as he says. Frank Sahwit and I were partners in crime.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">No way...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well done, Miles. At last, we have the real culprit cornered.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Like Mr. Edgeworth said, Franky operated the breaker. But... we were not responsible for Knightley's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">WH-WHAT!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Warden Roland. Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Judge Courtney. Would the Goddess of Law hear my confession?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Goddess of Law is merciful. She will absolve you.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I was... being threatened. That's why, I had no choice but to do as I was told.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, who was threatening you!?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">.....Sirhan Dogen! That assassin!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Dogen...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">It's been going on since that man came to the prison. I will never forget that day. When we were both alone, he suddenly said to me:</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I have many dogs outside the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">D... Dogs?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Loyal dogs who obey my every command.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I soon realized that what Dogen referred to were not really dogs. But his human henchmen... And, that's not all he said.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">You'd better watch how you treat me. If you don't want you and your family to become dog food.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I had no choice. I gave him the special cell. I gave him anything he desired.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Anything he desired... You don't mean! The Supplier...!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That's right. Anything he ordered, I would deliver to him. ...An underground dealership. I was the one who won over Franky. It was simple, I just offered him special privileges within the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And these underground dealings?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Once a week, in the middle of the night, Franky would shut off two of the breakers... ...so I could move from my office to the courtyard without being seen by the security camera. I would go past the fence, and drop the goods down the well near the prison. And then I'd sprinkle this perfume over it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that's the true identity of the sweet scent...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">The scent of perfume was a signal for Dogen's dog. After picking up the scent, it would carry the goods to Dogen. Of course, this had to be done while Elbird was away from his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'm surprised he never found out about it, pal.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">We have a strict timetable here at the prison. Meal time, exercise time... It's easy to know when he's away from his cell. And since little Rocky is afraid of Dogen's dog... I didn't have to worry about him making noise.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, having full knowledge of the prison's inner workings, she made the deliveries herself. This would have ensured there were no slip-ups.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Franky would turn the breakers back on in the early morning, and the delivery was complete. I then modified the timestamp on the security camera.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You have told us a great deal. The Goddess of Law accepts your penitent confession.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">As the warden of the prison, how could I have done such a foolish thing? The day Knightley was killed was also a delivery day. It seems Franky was working the breakers as usual. But, that day I had nothing to send. So I did not go to the courtyard at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The secret of the supply system... So then Warden Roland was...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">The police have been searching for Dogen's henchmen for ages. I've also been helping them, but...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But... ...no matter how much evidence we have on him, we can't get a single word out of him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the reason you kept on interrogating him...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes. It was to find his henchmen. I borrowed all the evidence from the police, and carried out the interrogation myself! I kept an eye on all his actions, and examined all of his mail!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mail... like his correspondence chess letters.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">But I could never uncover the true identity of his henchmen... This fear... It's something you could never understand.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. You were listening, right? I'd say this confession clears the warden of all suspicion. Is it really necessary to press her further than this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is it necessary to press her further?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, there is no need to question Warden Roland any further.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Are you just gonna let the warden get away like that!? She's the killer, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's not like you to overlook a culprit in plain sight, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... Right. <thought>There is still some suspicion surrounding the warden... We must press her further!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. My questioning isn't over yet. I'm sure the Goddess of Law isn't satisfied yet, either.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You mean to badger this woman further?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if she was threatened by Dogen... ...this does not prove she was not the culprit in this case. She was able to use the supply route... ...to transport Knightley's body!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do you have any evidence to support this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body gave off a sweet scent... The scent of perfume that was used to signify a delivery! Can you explain this fact?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh... Of course... Since I have made so many deliveries, the scent would've lingered around the well. When the body was moved through the well, the scent would have transferred to it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Elbird also testified to this fact.</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">That's it. For some reason, that well gave off a nice scent.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A nice scent?</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I don't know what it was, but it smelled sweet, like candy...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The lingering scent in the well would, of course, be picked up by anything passing through.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh.....!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Defense rests, I see. In that case, court is adjourned.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't there anything we can do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What should I do? Is this as far as I can go?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Is it over already?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes, Sebastian. It is. And now, court is officially adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Who... Who was that?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's not nice of you to adjourn things just like that, Courtney-pie.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you objecting to the court adjourning?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Of course not. I ain't got no ><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn>Kay:</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Woah there. Calm down Kay. Who wants some chocolate?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Is this a joke?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he, you'll have to excuse me. I just have one tiny request to make. As Simon Keyes' attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's right, you're the defense attorney in charge of this case, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Exactly! Did you all forget? That's so mean.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But you just left everything to Mr. Edgeworth and didn't do anything at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yes. That's right! That's why... I thought I'd do my job a bit.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do your job? ...That hardly sounds like you at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's to prepare for the trial. I'd like to ask the warden a few questions.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Surely you jest. What more would you expect to hear from her?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, Ms. Warden. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">My thoughts?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray believes that Simon is not the culprit. It seems that Ms. Warden also suspects someone other than Simon. I'd like to hear you out.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. What's Mr. Shields up to?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...He's trying to lure Warden Roland into testifying. Why was the supply route used to transport the body...? I'd say it was to pin the crime on Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! I see!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If he committed a murder here, he would be transferred to another prison. One with tighter security...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And that would get rid of the troublemaker!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. She wouldn't pass up a chance like that...!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey, hold on a sec! A culprit besides Simon? What do you mean! Simon was the one I was supposed to prosecute!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Exactly! So wouldn't it be better if Debeste also listened to what she has to say?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Amazing, Mr. Shields. You managed to drag Mr. Debeste into this too!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Warden Roland, is this acceptable?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">........ Oh, you! It's fine! It's fine! You understand a woman's heart!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Th-Thank you... Mademoiselle.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Actually, I've thought this over. I'd like to tell you my thoughts. You'll let me speak, won't you, Justine-darling?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Of course. You may speak.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Shields! Awesome!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Phew, that was a close shave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you, Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">No, no, I'm still leaving the rest to you. Remember what I said? A defense attorney never gives up... The fate of our client rests on our shoulders, after all. It'd be uncool if Uncle Ray didn't put that into practice. Now then, Miles. It's your turn to show you'll never give up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well then, will you listen to my story?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I believe that the culprit in this case could only have been Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">The victim... Mr. Knightley, was it? I think it is a truly terrible thing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Taking a man's life, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...That's how you'd go about saying it, isn't it? If only I had been more vigilant, his death would not have happened. That's why I want to clear up his regrets!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Warden Roland...! How considerate! I'm sure Mr. Knightley in Heaven is overflowing with gratitude!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is gratitude really what Knightley feels?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">I believe that the culprit in this case could only have been Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You seem very confident of that. How can you be so sure?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">The children of this home are all good little boys and girls. Believe in yourself, believe in your friends, and believe in me and the guards... There is no way any of these hard-working children could have committed a murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Quite an emotional reason. <thought>Makes sense, coming from someone like her.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Only Dogen would be capable of something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I have no idea what transpired between Dogen and the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley was being held in the detention center, and Dogen was in the prison. They couldn't make any contact. Don't you think that would've prevented trouble?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">The prison is quite confined, right? There were many ways for them to meet.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley was murdered days before he would have been sentenced to prison. Surely there weren't "many ways" a meeting could have occurred?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Even without a direct meeting, Dogen can still cause trouble. Mark my words.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">It simply could have been that Dogen was displeased with him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What could Knightley have done in the detention center to "displease" him?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That was just an example. You don't have to take it so seriously. Didn't I already say that I have no idea what transpired between them? Nevertheless.. You certainly are a serious one, Edgeworth-dear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wh-What's this? That... piercing gaze...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Always standing straight and stiff. Very nice! Looking very clever, my dear! I think I'm about to become your biggest fan!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth, stay focused! It's just a flesh wound!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">R... Right. <thought>Is this some form of psychological warfare...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to hear your thoughts about the circumstances surrounding the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well, I suppose it was a simple "job". During his booking, I learned that the victim had some kind of injury to his neck. He couldn't turn his neck to the right... I remember him saying something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Booking... that's the process one undergoes before being locked up in the detention center.</thought> It sounds like you don't really know a lot about Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I only know a little. In any case, he would've been an easy target for Dogen. Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard? The victim wouldn't even have had a chance to scream.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I see. Your opinion will be a very valuable reference. ...Could you add those last statements to your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Aww, you're making me blush. You're so c-u-t-e.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I'm just kidding. I'll continue.</line>
<line speaker="Add statements">"Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?" and "I'm sure it would have been a simple "job"."</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The chessboard...?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">The thing that the victim brought with him. It seemed like he really enjoyed playing chess. How could I have guessed that chisel would be hidden inside it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The chisel in the chessboard... That fact is only known by a select few people! This was the answer we arrived at from our reasoning, after all. So then, why does she know about this...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">In Dogen's hands, even a chisel is enough to be used as a lethal weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Roland">I'm sure it would have been a simple "job".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You certainly seem to hold strong feelings towards Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Th-That's... just natural. Remember my interrogations? That man, no matter how much evidence we find, he's still as slippery as a snake...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You've got a lotta guts!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That smug look he has on his face when he returns to his cell! Aaaaaargh! Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can sort of understand how you feel.</thought>x</line>
<line speaker="Roland">He probably had a dog dispose of the body. This is the truth of the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you mean to say the dog threw the body into the well?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Dogen has more than one dog, not just that black one, you know. Didn't I tell you? He has henchmen outside these walls as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean his henchmen outside of the prison aided him in this crime!?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Of course not. They would have been caught by the security gates. But, think about it. Wasn't he the "Supplier"? It's not hard to think he had "dogs" within the prison too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? Well then, why don't you tell me the names of those so-called dogs?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">If I knew that, I wouldn't have gone through so much trouble. In any case, it's still a possibility. Please try to consider it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She's dodging the question... Can't I pursue this line of thought any further?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Warden Roland's testimony is covered in lies. If I pick them apart one by one, her true colors will surely be revealed.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Warden Roland, you certainly are sharp-witted.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Hey, enough with the titles. Call me Patty, P-a-t-t-y.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..... H-However, there's something you were a little too knowledgeable about...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Uh hu hu. Embarrassed? You're such an inexperienced child, Edgeworth-dear!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....G-Gaaah.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Fight on! Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You said you didn't really know much about Knightley. If that's the case, how did you know about the chisel inside the chessboard?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh... O-Of course. The entrance check...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Enough with the poor excuses! The entrance check? The chessboard wasn't something Knightley brought with him. It was brought to him later by Mr. Keyes. He didn't even have it when he arrived here!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Th-That's...! M-My mistake. I meant the parcel check...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if we assume that, there are still many suspicious points! Why wasn't such a chisel immediately confiscated!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">A-Aiiaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Did you tell anyone about the trick to this chessboard?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I did not.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If no information about our investigation was leaked, then how did you find out? You could not have examined this during the entrance check or parcel check!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Certainly... Someone in the warden's position would never have let a chisel slip by.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. So, answer this, Warden Roland! When and how did you learn about the chessboard's secret!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. In that case, I shall answer for you. It is because...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I give up, Edgeworth-dear. It is as you say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">.....I interrogated Knightley. That's how I learned about... the chessboard. But... Please believe me! I didn't kill anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Enough. It would appear that we have uncovered some vital information. I'll ask you to testify once more. If that's airtight with you, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No objections here.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Th-Thank you, Edgeworth-dear! I'll do my best!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, Warden Roland, I trust there will be no lies from here on out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Her pool of lies is slowly running dry. Soon I will bring out her true nature!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">I wouldn't go so far as to call it an interrogation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She's piling lies on top of lies, not realizing that it only tightens the noose around her neck.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You speak with the new prisoners, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">That's right! I'm glad you understand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your testimony is not solid evidence. It requires more than just "understanding"!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, you may begin your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I wouldn't go so far as to call it an interrogation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're certain you interrogated him the day before the show?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes. Around 3 AM on the 27th.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>3 at night. That matches the time of death on Knightley's autopsy report...</thought> You summoned him that late at night and he wasn't asleep?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well, a guard was attacked in Knightley's cell, remember? After that incident, we checked his cell and inquired about the circumstances... I'm sure all that excitement made it hard to sleep. Knightley was wide awake, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, even though it was highly irregular, you still carried out this late-night interrogation.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Edgeworth-dear... You're so mean.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">It may have been irregular, but the truth is I had him moved. You can call it what you like, it still doesn't change the facts.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Please excuse him. I'll give my incompetent apprentice a good scolding later! But for now, Mademoiselle, what did you mean when you said, "you had him moved"?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I thought it was obvious, Monsieur. I spoke to him in my office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Her office... The route she used to move Knightley's body!</thought> Please add that statement to your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...Uh hu hu. Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Around 3 AM the day before the show, the victim was brought into my office."</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Around 3 AM the day before the show, the victim was brought into my office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And where is your office located exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">You know that sign in the detention center hallway?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You mean the one that says "No Entry"?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes. It's just a short walk up that aisle. About five minutes from the cell block.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've heard that room exits into the courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Of course. That side of the courtyard is my private garden. ...Oh, I get it. You're going to say I used that route to move the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, you must have been able to use it. If you used that route...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">For now, that is merely a possibility. There is no decisive evidence to support it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But there is no other way the body could have been moved!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Surely you haven't forgotten my theory that Simon Keyes dropped the body in the well?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">That's right! That's right! What she said!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... <thought>Pursuing this point further would be hazardous.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">I always make sure to talk to all the new arrivals.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you talk about?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">What indeed... It was just trifling conversation. What kind of animals he liked, what his hobbies were, that sort of thing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hobbies... I assume he mentioned chess?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh yes. That's all Knightley would ever talk about. Now that I think about it, the note he had in his room... It probably had something to do with chess too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So Warden Roland saw Knightley's note...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Mr. Knightley... Yes, we had a little chat.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what was Knightley like during the interrogation?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">He was very honest.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Kn-Knightley was...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">H-Honest, pal!?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">He also talked about a croissant and some kind of promo...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>En passant and chess piece promotions, I presume. Looks like he was his usual chess-loving self.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">After our talk, he went right back to his cell, I assure you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If he really returned to his cell, there is no way he would be a corpse now!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I know you're suggesting that I killed him during the interrogation, but... ...I couldn't possibly have had a motive to kill Knightley, could I? Dogen was the only one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She only hated Dogen...</thought> Please add that statement to your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Dogen was the one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim."</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Dogen was the one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only one you hated was Dogen... Am I correct?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes. Threatening me... And doing whatever he wants in this prison! That man... I will never forgive him! I will do whatever it takes to corner him! And his black dog too! They aren't fit to live in my home!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She's brimming with hostility, even towards Dogen's dog... At first glance, it would seem she has no motive for killing Knightley... However, her hostility extends to anyone connected to Dogen. If I consider that, the answer will naturally follow!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">She chats with the criminals...? The warden sure is easygoing, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Easygoing? She killed one of the criminals, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Since the guy was handcuffed, it would have been a pretty one-sided affair.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Warden Roland has to be the killer. I have faith in my reasoning so far!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. I'd like you to have a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It looks like a record of a chess game. Is there something wrong with it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was discovered in the victim's cell. It was Knightley's memo. Warden Roland, you also discovered this note in the very same place! And not just in Knightley's cell... But in Dogen's too, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Wh-What are you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't say that you don't know about the chessboard in the special cell.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After all, you would have kept an eye on Dogen's actions, down to the smallest details. No... To be more precise, it wasn't Dogen that you needed to keep an eye on.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The warden was searching for Mr. Dogen's henchmen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From the start, I found it strange that the warden interrogated the prisoners personally. Since he used his henchmen to threaten harm to her family... ...Warden Roland interrogated Dogen, to expose them.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">So... What are you saying!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As you inspected Dogen's mail, you must have known! That he played correspondence chess!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Urk!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And then Knightley appeared, with a chess memo in hand. We deduced that he and Dogen were connected. You must have arrived at the same conclusion as well. However! You went one step too far in your reasoning. You thought Knightley was one of Dogen's henchmen, who had come to kill you!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So, that's why you interrogated Knightley-boy. If the boss won't crack, go after his henchmen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In addition, you discovered something when you were interrogating him. Inside his chessboard, you found a portable chisel!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The murder weapon...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To Warden Roland, the chisel was a symbol of Dogen. And that was the final straw. You believed Knightley was one of Dogen's henchmen and you killed him!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems there will be no rebuttal. Judge Courtney! Your verdict!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Though it is incredibly unfortunate, there seems to be no room for doubt. I shall announce my verdict! For the murder of Horace Knightley...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Twice my sacred verdict has been interrupted...! Who was that!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Hu... Hu hu hu hu...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Warden Roland...?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Uh hu hu hu hu... Oh, how strange! You guys really don't understand anything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would seem the one who doesn't understand is you.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Me? Oh, I understand one thing very well. There is a huge contradiction in your logic, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Once she's cornered, she starts spouting nonsense. Pay it no heed. Judge Courtney, your verdict...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am interested in hearing what the warden has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I thought so. I just have one thing I want to say.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">O-One...!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Please take a good look at the autopsy report.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The autopsy report... The one I brought with me?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I heard exactly what you said earlier, Justine-darling. You said the wound was four inches deep.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Four inches.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No way...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Could that tiny chisel really have made a wound four inches deep?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I... IMPOSSIIBLEEEEE!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">How could I have made such an error... Oh, forgive me, Goddess of Law!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well, I believe that overturns your hypothesis! What will you do now, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-Wh-Wh-What'll we do!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I-I-It'll be alright, pal! Mr. Edgeworth always...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Whoa, hey now, he's gone all white!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, you're a defense attorney, aren't you! Isn't there something you can do, pal!? Do that "turnabout" thing! Make some earth-shattering objection!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray's a hard worker, but... ...without decisive evidence we're just whipping a dead horse here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Does that mean it's hopeless!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The true killer is Warden Roland. If it's not her, then nothing that's happened fits. But the chisel isn't the murder weapon. Are there any other sharp objects here...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There are still many mysteries remaining in this case. However, we do not have the evidence to solve them at this present time. We have no choice... But to continue this battle in the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">That would just give the killer a chance to destroy evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you mocking the court?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">N-No, no, no. I didn't mean anything like that. Y-You look perplexed, Miles. Thought of anything yet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The chisel is not the murder weapon. In that case, what is? ...It's no use! We're back where we started!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No objections, Prosecutor Edgeworth? By the way... Any baseless statements will be punished accordingly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">................................ <thought>It's no good! I can't think of anything! I need more time...!</thought> ................ I regret to say, I have no...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No! Mr. Edgeworth! Remember what Mr. Shields said! If we give up, Simon will...! Have you forgotten that sad look on his face? He was the one who suffered most from Knightley's death! If we can't save him, who will? Besides... ...Simon believes in us! So, we can't give up!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles... Looks like you've found a good partner. It's like little Kay says. Whenever you're backed into a corner, think of your client. Keep fighting until the very end... Isn't that the feeling you're getting? Gregory... Your old man... No matter what trouble he faced, he would always turn things around and save his client. You've got his blood in you, right? In that case, you're the only one who can turn this around...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">....... Judge Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The look in your eyes has suddenly changed... If you do intend to speak. you'd better be prepared to face the consequences. Your logic thus far has been misplaced numerous times. If this were to happen again, I will consider you unfit to call yourself a prosecutor... And you will hand over your badge.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...That's right. My reasoning about this case has indeed been misplaced numerous times... Have I made a grave miscalculation...? ...Wait. My logic is... misplaced?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Still silent. I cannot condone this waste of time. Well then...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I will announce my verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's it! I have to turn my logic around! My logic isn't misplaced, it's been misled!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This court finds the defendant, Simon Keyes...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't it a little early to hand down a verdict?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I actually think it's rather late. Don't you agree, Justine-darling?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Enlighten us.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Wh-What!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Try to remember! The eyewitness account about his dog, and his absence from the Animal Show... When I first heard that information, my suspicion immediately fell on Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm amazed you take such pride in retelling your previous failings...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, was that not the killer's aim? What if we assumed that was their intention from the start? Of course! The chisel served the same purpose!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley's body was stabbed in the same spot with multiple sharp objects. This shows that, he was stabbed with the chisel after the real murder weapon was removed. By soaking the chisel in Knightley's blood... ...the killer wanted to misled us into thinking the chisel was the murder weapon! Why? That's because...! Why did the killer want us to think the chisel was the murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Warden Roland. This chisel really was used to kill Knightley after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Miles. Weren't you listening before?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It appears I made a mistake in allowing you to speak.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>It seems I was wrong... Why did Warden Roland makes this chisel out to be the murder weapon? If I can figure out the reason, the truth should reveal itself.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It would be pointless to allow any more utterances.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Please allow me to make one more statement.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Very well. Go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The chisel was used to get Knightley expelled!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Get Knightley expelled? But Knightley was already dead by then...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>Looks like I was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! Stay focused, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Right. <thought>Why did Warden Roland makes this chisel out to be the murder weapon? If I can figure out the reason, the truth should reveal itself.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It would be pointless to allow any more utterances.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Please allow me to make one more statement.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Very well. Go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Warden Roland. You made use of this chisel's image.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Chisel's... image? What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Debeste. When you see this chisel, what does it suggest to you?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Eh? Something like... "Dogen is the killer", right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Now do you understand? That was the warden's aim.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! She wanted us to suspect the person with the chisels!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That was her plan from the very beginning. To make Sirhan Dogen out to be the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I understand your logic. It is true the warden did not think kindly of Dogen. But... you understand, don't you? This alone does not prove she is the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>As I thought... It's not enough! The remaining chance... ...is for me to find the real murder weapon!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If you have no more evidence, I believe this conversation is over.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I could prove it, if I found the real murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It doesn't matter what you say! We did a clean sweep of this place!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It is as Sebastian says. In the end, we could not find any weapons. In other words, such proof is impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. The murder weapon must still be somewhere in the prison. ...As long as this exists.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">The security gate!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. ...You remember its name after all.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Are you mocking me!? It's because of those things... That you can't take metal objects in or out of this place! ...Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. As long as those security gates exist, the murder weapon should still be here.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...That also means no weapon could have been brought into the prison. In the end, we're back to that same mystery after all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, surely you've realized? If the real murder weapon is still in the prison... ...one must also consider how it got there in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The chisel was concealed within the chessboard... ...but the chisel is not the real murder weapon. Which means the real murder weapon must have been smuggled in somehow!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The way it was smuggled in... Can you prove that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...! How Warden Roland brought the weapon into the prison...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You had evidence transferred from the precinct...?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Yes. We borrowed all the evidence concerning Dogen. I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Th-That's it! She could have used that! This shows another way a weapon could be brought into the prison!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Professor Edgeworth! So that's how you bring metal objects into the prison!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. With this, even something metal could be...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Exactly how does that let metal objects be brought into the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What! You really can't use that to bring metal objects into the prison!? Professor Edgeworth, I'm disappointed in you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph! <thought>Sorry to let you down...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, there really isn't a way to bring metal objects into the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, there is a way, besides sending it in a package. And this shows that method!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then, Professor! Show it to us!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm not sure if I should say this in front of Kay...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yesterday, Dogen said this.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Yes. My bells... There are only two in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Only two?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">They're custom-made. Attached to my knife and Anubis' collar. Even though I can only rely on my ears... ...I can easily identify them. Alas, one has been confiscated and is not in my possession.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible the murder weapon was brought in... ...as confiscated evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen's knife was confiscated, and stored on the premises. Furthermore... a bell was attached to the knife!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It can't be...! The bell on that chisel...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. The killer took it from the knife and reattached it to the chisel.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-But the only fingerprints on this chisel are Knightley's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The killer probably wore gloves when they made the switch. She made the chisel out to be the murder weapon by attaching Dogen's bell. And in doing so, made Dogen appear to be the culprit. Furthermore, the handling of the set of evidence that this bell originally belonged to... ...was only possible for someone with the proper authority.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Who, sir! Who had that authority!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Why don't we ask the warden what she thinks?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Y-You can find bells anywhere! Anyone could have attached it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I see. So you don't know. These bells are Dogen's trademark. There are only two in the world!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">WHA........ WHAAAAAAAT!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And so, attaching the bell would, naturally, make you the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">D-Do you have evidence that I have the knife? You don't, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course. I understand. In that case, Mr. Debeste! I'd like to request an investigation. Immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Eh? Ah. But... if you find it, it'd be problematic for me...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That doesn't matter now! It is necessary that we reveal the truth! You are a prosecutor, are you not?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">........ Well, even if you say that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curse this useless prosecutor! If only I still had investigative rights!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Besides, we can't investigate without the warden's permission... Right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no way she would approve! We have no choice but to investigate ourselves!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">If you don't have evidence, there's no use in continuing this conversation.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...The Goddess of Law does not smile upon those with no evidence. This will have to be continued in the Courtroom...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Not good...! If we give the warden more time here... ...she'll definitely destroy the evidence. It seems like I have no choice but to raise an objection and stall for time...! B-But, I don't have anything definite. Is that... really acceptable? Is it really like me to do something this reckless... N-No... Not good! Now is not the time for hesitation! Right now, I'm not a prosecutor, but an attorney's assistant. I need to protect my client! I'm the only one who can save him now. In that case... ...even if it's a one-in-a-million chance, I have to take it! It's sink or swim. Should I raise an objection?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It almost feels like I've turned into a certain bluffing defense attorney. But, right now I can't come to a standstill here!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No, I must not object now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's not like you to let the killer get away when they are right before your eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's right. I can't come to a standstill here!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth? What now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I just realized something...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What would that be... Pray tell?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Naturally, the whereabouts of the real murder weapon... Dogen's knife!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth! Is that really true!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. <thought>Though it is a lie...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I find that hard to believe. This isn't a bluff, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. You underestimate me. The word "bluff" does not exist in my dictionary. <thought>Ngh... This is bad for my heart...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">Th-There's no way you could know... Because, such a thing doesn't even exist!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Well then, could you enlighten us? Where is the real murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Think...! Think! Somewhere the police didn't look... A blind spot in this animal-filled prison. A hiding place the warden would have complete confidence in. Hm? Hiding place...? Come to think of it...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">............ It was inevitable. Anubis, show them your mouth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Th-The same method...? No... It couldn't be, could it...!? But...! There aren't that many ways to hide things from an investigator's eyes!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth! How long do you intend to keep us waiting?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's possible... B-But... I'm taking a big gamble here.</thought> The place where the real murder weapon is hidden is... here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Was the murder weapon really hidden in there!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's not enough information, please show us in more detail.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm. Around here...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There's no way I can accept such a vague statement.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>It was no good after all... A hiding place the warden would have confidence in... I'll have to look at this through her eyes.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Show us once again where the murder weapon is hidden.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Here, in the courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's not enough information, please show us in more detail. Where is the real murder weapon hidden?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right! The murder weapon is hidden here!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I don't think you could hide something here, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph! <thought>Even Gumshoe rebutted...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">It's pointless to keep searching, Edgeworth-dear. Because it's most certainly not here!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why is the warden so confident? Maybe she hid it in a place where we couldn't approach...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not just some place we couldn't approach, but some place only the warden could get to. It's definitely a possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's it...! Back then!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's the matter, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really! Why?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!</thought> Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The chisel...?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">WHAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We can confirm that the metal detector reacted to the alligator! Judge Courtney. Please have the insides of the alligator examined!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I give my consent. We'll have to call a veterinarian.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">I can make that little girl open her mouth! Can I help?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, go ahead. Warden Roland! Discovering the real murder weapon will settle this matter once and for all! Why don't you do the honorable thing and confess now?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I-I! What would I have to confess!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, you can just wait for your fate to be sealed.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">N-Nrggggg!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aah! We found it, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Just where you said it would be!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It's over. Patricia Roland! The real murder weapon is none other than Dogen's knife... And the one who murdered Horace Knightley can only be you!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Dogen was the evil one! I didn't do anything wrong! It was completely reasonable! That guy was one of Dogen's henchmen! Him...! If only he had never come to my home... I... I could at least still be happy! My special paradise... He ruined it! All of it! Him! That no-good assassin! Him... Him! HIHIHIHIHIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Mr. Debeste of the best! We have the results!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Debeste of the best? Looks like even the forensic officers have it tough.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Forensics">We found traces of Knightley's blood on Dogen's knife! It was just like you said! You're the best, Mr. Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Alright! Good job! But don't stop there, keep the praise coming!</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Yes, sir! You're so incredible, it brings tears to my eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...From sorrow?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well done, Sebastian. Next comes the follow-up investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hm? What are you talking about, Justine? Hasn't the case been solved already?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We have not yet confirmed if Knightley truly was one of Dogen's henchmen.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is also a chance that Warden Roland jumped to conclusions...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....O-Oh? Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That is the remaining uncertainty in this case.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ah... Uhh... A-Anyways, let's keep investigating. Hey, you there! Come with me! Since I'm The Best, the truth will appear before me first! When that moment arrives, make sure you don't miss it!</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Yes, sir! I'm looking forward to witnessing your first-rate ability!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Let's goooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We live in troubling times, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The would-be assassin of the president was found murdered in the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley had not planned to assassinate the president!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The truth is not as vital as you seem to believe it to be. Not to the world... ...And not to the law.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That can't be right!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Believe what you will. However... ...as long as Prosecutor Edgeworth remains a prosecutor, it is an inescapable reality.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A prosecutor is not someone who demands a guilty verdict. That is what I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Those are merely your values. The law is not the plaything of any one person. If you will not submit to that... You will do well to prepare for the consequences.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's that supposed to mean, pal? Don't tell me you're gonna...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now then, this is where I must take my leave, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney is right. The law should not serve any one person's desires. However, if the truth is bent as a result of that... ...can that really be called "justice"?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! Simon!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">B-Boss!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">What happened? They said you could come out already?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">W-Well... Honestly, I don't know for sure. All of a sudden they were like, "You're free to go" and "You should thank Mr. Edgeworth".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, that's because he found out who the real murderer was.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">R-Really? He did? Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ah! Ooh! Nowaynowaynoway! Even if you glare at me like that, it's useless! I'm innocent, after all! You can't make me guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon, Simon... You should thank him, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Y-Y-You're right! Thank you very much!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">I wanna thank you, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Good grief...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Um, Mr. Defense Attorney? Can I ask you just one more question?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, you may. <thought>But I'm not a defense attorney...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">I thought that Knightley and I were friends. No! I mean best friends! I always thought we were...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You don't think so anymore...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">W-Well, I'm just wondering. There were some things I had no idea about. Like how... he could hate someone enough to kill him. That's why... m-maybe he n-never trusted me, either?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon... That's not true.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Y-You're lying! Because if I had known, I could have stopped him! I would've told him he had no need to be angry with anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes, I don't think he disliked you either. <thought>Let's show him proof that Knightley trusted him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Simon">What is... this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's proof of Knightley's trust in you.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">But I don't really get it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't really understand either...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, maybe this is what you were going for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... yes. <thought>I must be tired from working for so long.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's what I gave to...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley his a chisel inside it. Most likely to aid in his escape.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">E-E-E-Escape...! He used me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He trusted in you. He knew you'd bring it to him without looking into it and without question. And in doing just that, you were caught up in everything.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........*sniff* *sniff* Waaaaaaaaah! Knightley! You idiot!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like he gets it.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon is not as dumb as he looks, after all. I'm sure he'll be back to normal by tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was that supposed to be a compliment...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oooooh... *hic*... I'll be strong! I'll become a splendid wild animal tamer, for Knightley's sake!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excellent, that's the spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ah... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">The Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow, that sounds like fun! Let's go, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. Well, I'll think about it.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Well, we need to get back to practicing right away. You'll be with Regent today!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Whaaaat? Th-The tiger!? Nowaynowaynoway!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">It'll be fine. He's a good boy.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">N-No way! There is no way it will be fine! Please cut me a breeeaaaaak! Boooooooosss...!!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">And there they go. But, man. Bravo. Bravo. You really put on a good show today, Miles.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's all thanks to you, Mr. Shields. Without your help, she might have gotten away. Not to mention allowing us to continue the investigation...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh man, cut it out already. You're gonna make me blush.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I never know when you are being serious.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray is always serious. So how was it, Miles? How did it feel to be a defense attorney? To save people?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A defense attorney...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">But that really took me back. It was just like being next to your old man again. Ha ha, it's been a while since I felt this good.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was... Well... <thought>It's somewhat difficult to say it was a good thing.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">C'mon, Miles. Are you sure you don't want to be a defense attorney?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........What?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You know, pick up where your father left off. Don't you want to save people like he did?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What are you talking about, pal? Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But is it really that unusual for a prosecutor to become a defense attorney these days?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Unusual" isn't the problem here!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hey, don't be so upset. It's normal, you know, normal.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's not...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Normal, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ha ha ha. You'd all make for a powerful defense team.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields... I am a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">And Uncle Ray is a defense attorney. That's why... ...I'm being serious about this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, that's just my opinion. Feel free to drop by anytime if you have a change of heart. I'll be waiting for ya.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Follow... in my father's footsteps?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Me... become a defense attorney?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my Dad!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Should I become a defense attorney... ...like my father?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh! <thought>As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Should I have a problem with it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhooh! <thought>I don't think that left a good impression...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. There is a contradiction in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I cannot authorize this statement.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... And why not?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Because it's obvious you're bluffing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nguuuoooh! <thought>Is that the impression I give off? ...Next time for sure, I will present evidence that will silence her for good!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen, what do you think of this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">You can ask me all you like, but I have no answers for you. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Does this mean you do not wish to answer?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">If that's how you wish to interpret it, I cannot stop you. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghoooh!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Assassin's been talking to his dog all this time. Well, I guess he's much more fun to talk to than Miles here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... <thought>So I'm beneath a dog...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen, there is a contradiction in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">A contradiction, you say... Anubis, what do you think? Mm-hmm. I see. Anubis says there is no contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>Are you saying that even a dog could see that!? In that case, I'll make him "nod" with evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Elbird. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like Mr. Elbird's busy chasing a fly! He's not listening at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... <thought>He doesn't feel like listening...</thought> In that case, I'll make him pay attention with a straight punch!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, let's settle this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Elbird. Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">Your fists are pathetic! You think you can break my guard with that jab!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nggh! That was supposed to be a hard straight punch...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like he dodged it cleanly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I won't miss next time!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's go for the T.K.O.!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Warden Roland, would you have a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">What's this, Mr. Edgeworth? You want my attention so badly?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I didn't mean...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I'll give you as many hugs as you like!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Run, Miles! Run!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">O... K. <thought>It seems that I'm in danger... I should withdraw for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Warden Roland. That statement you just made is contradictory.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Oh? Is there something strange about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, this evidence... Nnghooh! <thought>Her glare is terrifying. I'll have to think things over a little more before jumping to conclusions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Warden Roland, what do you think of this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">What do I think... Well, what do you think? Ah, yes, yes, is that it? I think so too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">It's utterly ridiculous, I wholesomeheartedly agree!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>It seems I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing unusual about this area.</line>
