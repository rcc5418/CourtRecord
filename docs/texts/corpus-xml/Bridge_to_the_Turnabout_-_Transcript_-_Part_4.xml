<title>Bridge to the Turnabout</title>
<line speaker="Pearl">Good morning! ...Oh? Are you by yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah... Morning, Pearls.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">M-Mr. Nick! Please tell me! What's going to happen to Mystic Maya?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm sorry... We don't know yet. The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Oh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Um... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I have to admit it's kinda strange...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Today's testimony...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the prosecution.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait, what!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The prosecutor is squeezing her for a confession. ...Or so I heard.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What...!? </line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who else would it be but Godot?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">G-Godot...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">The Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah... Thanks, Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Prosecutor Godot intends to nail this case shut today. Be prepared to fight like there's no tomorrow!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...You don't have to tell me that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know. I can already see it in your eyes. You're not the same fever-ridden, frantic maniac you were yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's strange... On the way here, I decided that today would be the end of all this. Almost immediately after I made that decision, I felt myself getting stronger.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Interesting... Maybe you've passed your cold onto someone else, literally. And with that... I leave the rest in your capable hands... partner.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Thanks...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...I still don't have answers for most of the riddles plaguing this case. The circumstances around the murder of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, no, I mean Ms. Misty Fey... The impossible flight Larry claims to have seen... And... What that woman is really after...</thought> I will solve them all and bring this whole tragedy to an end!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Court is now in session for the trial of Iris of Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Who? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I see, Your Honor... <thought>So they're brothers! That explains a lot...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">My poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">During yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a confession to make.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">C-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witness, is there something that you want to confess to?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-It's alright... What is it...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are... Are you actually confessing!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the cover up, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an accomplice to the murder!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... Yes. That's correct.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Whaaaaaaat!? <thought>Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Grrr, that Godot... So this is the confession they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Now then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Iris was covering for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, but "main family"...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Wake up and smell the coffee, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's ridiculous! Maya could never do such a--</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... ...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I thought I was prepared for the unexpected... But I never imagined the case would wind up going in this direction...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So it was in self-defense?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris never went to the Inner Temple that night. And that the person who did go was... that woman... ...Iris even admitted it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, Mr. Wright. Please proceed with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... What do you have to say, witness?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, Your Honor...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What were you doing at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why didn't you stop them from fighting!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...What happened after that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She moved in to deliver a fatal strike?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait a minute! What was this weapon...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It-It was... some kind of dagger.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>A dagger, huh...?</thought> And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes... Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Do you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...</thought> The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You should try some nice, sweet café con leche at least once, Trite...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-You do? But this witness is your own client!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, well... N-Nevertheless...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Nnngghh...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...OK, now. Let's continue.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Iris">She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She threw her staff away?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes. That's what I saw...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... <thought>Yeah, it's odd alright.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...And then?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Maya, she turned things around and then... ...she used the weapon she had taken and lunged forward for a strike!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Witness! Are you absolutely certain!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes... B-But believe me, she had no choice! If Mystic Maya hadn't done something...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Maya Fey's name would've been written on this autopsy report instead.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Yes, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This is bad... I still can't put the pieces together... Unless I find a contradiction  in her testimony, Maya's going to get blamed for this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">I... I only have this to say...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...So you're saying Maya Fey was the one who stabbed Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Sister Iris! Is that really what you saw?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Tsk, tsk, tsk, Trite. If your mug is filled with black and bitter suspicions... The only way to get rid of them is to drink them down quick... ...Like this!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Umm... I know that's supposed be a metaphor, but I don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">There's only one thing you need to "get", Trite. It's called evidence... Now hurry up... Before my next cup gets cold!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What does that mean...? Is Godot waiting for me to point out the contradictions?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I'd like to avoid the whole spirit channeling thing if I can... Not only would it be inadmissible as evidence... ...but I think it might actually hurt our standing with the judge. First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! ...Well, Sister Iris? What do you have to say?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Uhh, err, I...</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, well...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>But there is something strange about this whole testimony!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">M-Mr. Wright...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you ask me... ...the only thing that seems strange is the angle of Mr. Trite's index finger.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Eh...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite, sticking your finger in an electrical outlet might be safer for you. Otherwise it might get bitten off the next time you poke it in the wrong place!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Arrrrgh...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I still don't think that Ms. Deauxnim would ever attack Maya... If you think about their relationship, it's obvious!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Why don't you think it over one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ho-How can you be so sure...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Because the victim's real name was not "Elise Deauxnim". Her real name was... "Misty Fey".</line>
<line speaker="Judge">..."Fey"?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A-Are you serious!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's no doubt about it. <thought>It looks like Iris had no idea...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">I can hardly believe it...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Ugh...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! Upon first hearing the witness's testimony, it seemed natural enough. ...However. In light of some facts that have just been presented...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">One, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes? What is this one little impossible thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Umm... Could you get to your point?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Anyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is that the dagger the witness testified to seeing...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Obviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a bloodstain!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? The pine tree...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Which means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the victim, correct!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">I didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then... The testimony we've just heard had numerous unbelievable aspects to it. However! After having found the very dagger the witness spoke of... ...I believe we can consider her testimony to be credible.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Cute girls never lie. Ever.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Umm... About what, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">About the incident you saw... The battle between the two women!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...That was a very heart-breaking story.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I don't know if there were any bad feelings between them, but... It had been 17 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. ...Perhaps they simply didn't recognize each other anymore...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... That seems reasonable. Now then, Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Iris, where were you standing when you witnessed all this?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Umm... What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What happened to the victim's staff then?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Nothing sounds especially strange yet...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">What did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">As they say... "A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal".</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe the correct description of a cornered fox is "scared and petrified".</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>You were the one who started it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Anyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you absolutely certain that's what you saw!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... Yes, I'm almost certain.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"Almost"...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What did she just say!?</thought> S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">We know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nnrgh... <thought>I don't have anything to counter that yet...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Where did that dagger go?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">According to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That is the most likely explanation, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">After being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Until now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Wh-What do you mean? What's so wrong about my testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">According to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes... That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the stomach, right?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes, I think so...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her back.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This proves that the victim was stabbed from behind, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Umm, is that all you have to say?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Iris... How about it!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... W-Well, it's just...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you ask me, you're just being too naïve about the whole thing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Godot! Explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The witness was quite unambigious [sic] about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she couldn't see clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">A human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Light...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">By the way, did you know? The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training... ...the stone lantern in the garden is to always be lit.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Impossible...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly pitch black in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Most enlightening...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Yes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">N-- Nooooooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Ordeeer!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Here, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Why is the judge just sitting there with that look on his face...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...What's wrong, Your Honor? Was that flame too hot?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This lantern... There's something written on it!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Why... It's written in blood!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Oooh boy...! So the judge didn't know about that yet...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Written... in blood?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It... It says...! It says, "Maya" upside-down!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Wh-What the...!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the blood that was draining out of her body!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It certainly looks that way...</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hang on... Hang on just a minute! What are you all talking about!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What do you mean, "What are we all talking about?"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We're talking about the message written in blood...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>C-Could it be...? He can't see the bloody writing at all...!? Now that I think of it, he did say something to me yesterday...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So that's what he meant by that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...In any case, this is obviously an important clue. We now know that the crime scene was dark... ...and that the victim scrawled this message on the stone lantern! Well, Mr. Godot? Anything further?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">M-Mr. Godot?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...! Errr, umm... OK then... Let's move on.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Godot is literally shaking, and somehow, I don't think it's from caffeine overdose.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I believe it has now been established... ...that Ms. Deauxnim was killed by Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Th-That's... just wrong!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Now it's time to turn our attention to you.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">After the victim died, you did something, didn't you? Let's hear it. ...We're all ears.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...So you moved the body.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... A terrible trick of fate.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I believe you're looking for "twist of fate", Your Honor.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">I intended to return to the Inner Temple after taking care of the body... But...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You were spotted by the head nun, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes... And that's why I couldn't go back.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Your story makes sense, I suppose. Mr. Wright, go ahead with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So you waited until everything was over before making a move?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">N-No, it's not like that...</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">She saw someone murdered right in front of her eyes... It's not surprising that she was a little timid...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Yes, I suppose that's true. Sometimes when I'm watching lawyers argue back and forth with each other... ...I feel so helpless that I just sit quietly and wait for them to reach a conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...Isn't it your job as the judge to mediate the argument!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">It wasn't until Mystic Maya saw me... ...that it finally dawned on her what she had done.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then... You knew...? You knew the significance of the name "Maya Fey"...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes... Of course I did.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That's odd... I mean, Sister Bikini didn't recognize Maya's name, let alone her position...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Anyway... She was a very special person indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why did you do that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Because I didn't want Mystic Maya to be suspected in any way. I thought the best thing would be to remove the body from the crime scene...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You moved her body all by yourself...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes. I did. It would have been impossible if it wasn't for the snow...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>The snow, huh...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's pretty amazing you could make it all the way across... That's a rickety old bridge.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It looks worse than it is. It's surprisingly sturdy despite its age.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It's like they say, "Idiots are too stupid to catch even a simple cold."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...But there's one other thing that bothers me. Why not just throw the body into the Eagle River?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It would have been much easier than dragging it all the way to Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I thought that it would still cast too much suspicion on Mystic Maya... That's why I tried to take the body as far away as possible...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Makes perfect sense to me! ...For the time being. Anyway... What did you do after you crossed the bridge?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The snowmobile? <thought>I knew that would show up sooner or later...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, I had the key. I used the snowmobile to travel from Hazakura Temple to Dusky Bridge.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This is the part that was in question the other day. Should I ask for more details...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...Forget it, there's plenty of other things to go after in this testimony. Iris had the key to the snowmobile. There's nothing strange about that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let me hear more about this snowmobile ride.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, it was very cold that night... So I rode it all the way to the foot of the bridge.</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">I'm sorry, witness... But now, I've got a problem with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Excuse me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Godot... What are you up to now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">That night... After the head nun left the remainder of the training to you... ...she said she walked from the Inner Temple back to Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes... I'm fairly certain that's what the record indicates.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Let's recall her comments on the subject...</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">Maybe... But, when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...The snowmobile was in front of the Main Gate. This is one of those contradictions, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Or-Order! ...Mr. Godot! Wh-Why are you pointing out contradictions in the witness's testimony!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Let's just say I like things to be neat and tidy, OK?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Umm... Well... Maybe... S-Sister Bikini missed it. Yes, maybe she didn't see it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You think she missed it...? <thought>That doesn't sound right...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Whatever. Even I don't think this is decisive enough to warrant any more time or effort. It's just... You'd better be careful in your testimony. That's all I wanted to say. A smart little cookie like you shouldn't have any trouble understanding that.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What was that all about...? Why would Godot want to give me a hint...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If you really did move her body by snowmobile... ...then there should be tracks left in the snow, right?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well yes, naturally you would expect tracks.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This picture was presented at yesterday's trial... ...Are these the tracks from that ride?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes... I think they are.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But... I can only see one set of tracks here.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I don't see what's so strange about that. Snow was still falling when I left Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see... Snow was still falling, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And then when the murder took place, it had already stopped. That's why there are such fresh-looking tracks.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How about it, Mr. Wright? What do you think about this testimony...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>When the murder took place, the snow had already stopped...? That doesn't make sense if you stack it up against the other evidence.</thought> ...Your Honor! I'd like the statement Iris just made added to the testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But... Does it have something to do with the case?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All will be made clear if you allow her statement to be added to the record.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! This should be fun! You. Let's get this snow business cleared up, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Nothing I've heard sounds strange at all. I'd better not get too worked up about it...</thought> ...I'm fine, Your Honor. I have no problems with her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Is that what you were doing when Sister Bikini saw you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes, th-that's right... She probably thought the worst...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>"Probably"...? More like "definitely".</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... I see... So Sister Bikini mistakenly thought you were the one that murdered Ms. Deauxnim...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. It's my fault that this case has gotten so confusing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There have been a lot of contradictions in your testimony so far. This time... are you sure it's all true?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Y-Yes. I am.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">When the murder happened, the snow had already stopped. According to you, that's why the snowmobile tracks were so clear...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Th-That's right! I'm certain of it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I think I've trapped her this time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">... I see how you think... Snow, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What is going on here?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>If the snow really had stopped by the time of the murder... ...it'd mean there's a bigger hole in her story than that movie The Grid: Revelations!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Well then, Mr. Trite, perhaps you'd like to share your theory with us? Let's see what's up your sleeve... or rather, at the end of your index finger!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't want to believe it, but I don't think my logic is failing me... ...Iris is trying to pin the murder on Maya! But why would she want to do that...? There's only one reason I can think of...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred. But I'm sorry, Iris. That just isn't possible.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is the weather data from the night of the murder. According to this, the snow didn't stop until 10:50 PM. But you couldn't have crossed Dusky Bridge at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">W-Why do you say that!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Because 5 minutes before the snow stopped... ...Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning and had caught on fire.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What did you say!? Th-The bridge... It was on fire...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You don't mean to say... you didn't know about it? It was because of that lightning strike that the bridge burned down!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Whaaaaaat!? But it can't... It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It looks like you still haven't figured it out. No matter how hard you try to deceive or conceal the truth... ...you can't pull the wool over the eyes of a real defense attorney!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Nooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Order!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The bridge was already on fire when the incident took place. That's right! The Inner Temple was already totally cut off from the outside world! There's no way she could have crossed the bridge, body or no body!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Uh... Aaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witness! Even my patience has its limits. Any further lying and I will find you in contempt of court! Do you have anything to say for yourself!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ugggh...</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">The only person here that is truly contemptible is you... ...old man!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Me!? How dare you!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Whether this witness lied or not doesn't mean squat right now.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-S-Squat!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The important thing now is to find out the truth. ...Isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes, of course. But...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Whether it was snowing, or not snowing, or whether the bridge was burning or not... There are 2 facts that can't be disputed. First, the body of Elise Deauxnim was discovered in the Hazakura Temple Courtyard. And second, the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...witnessed Iris desecrating Elise Deauxnim's body!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...! <thought>H-He makes a good point... on both accounts.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Th-That's right! I'm not lying!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What are you claiming this time!?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I wasn't myself at all that night. ...So my memory is still somewhat hazy!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You have stood at that witness stand and testified this entire time! Are you telling us now that your memory of that night is hazy...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">It is only human to err. If you're so perfect, Trite, maybe you can explain this for the court?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What is it...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">When the murder happened, the bridge had already burnt down. But somehow the body traveled across the bridge and was found in the temple courtyard. Perhaps you have some kind of perfect explanation for this little magic trick?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugh...! Well not exactly, no... <thought>I know there must be some other way she got across that burnt-out bridge. But unless I can somehow demonstrate it... We'll never know the truth!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">It looks like the defense is not prepared to offer a suitable explanation...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You see what I mean? In other words... You're in no position to suggest that this lady's testimony isn't the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaaack!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then. Witness, let's hear your testimony once more.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">About what, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You've admitted that you moved the victim's body. Nevertheless, your prior testimony contained a rather large inconsistency. ...Please add an explanation for that to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...Will this be her final testimony...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Other than walking over the bridge, there's no way to move the body.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So it was just a misunderstanding, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This is a photo of Dusky Bridge after it burned down from the lightning blast. It was taken on the morning after the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It certainly was burned to a crisp... And one of the suspension wires is gone... It's amazing the whole bridge didn't fall. Clearly it would be impossible to carry a corpse across a bridge in this condition.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Unless I do something to discredit this testimony... ...it's going to be deemed as the  truth... ...and Maya will be  accused of murder!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite. I'm only going to say it one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It is only human to err. And... ...only humans can spot the errors of our ways.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>The more sense he makes, the less sense he makes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright, Mr. Wright! Please begin your final cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Other than walking over the bridge, there's no way to move the body.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, but if the snow had already stopped when the incident took place...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I couldn't have crossed the bridge. ...Naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But... I think it's just like Mr. Godot said... The body did make it across somehow...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A dead body flying over a burning bridge... I wouldn't exactly rule out the possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You're saying it's possible? Don't make me laugh. The only thing that's possible about your claim is that it's been pulled out of thin air!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't know about that. In any case... We have a witness who did see it happen.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Pwweposterous!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Who is it!? Who is this witness!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I can't chicken out here... I've gotta keep on the attack and go, go, go!</thought> Ms. Elise Deauxnim's brilliant and highly-gifted apprentice, Laurice Deauxnim!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Brilliant...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Highly-gifted...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Apprentice...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Remember what he said in his testimony. That night he was at the mountain shack, Heavenly Hall. And that's when he witnessed the event. I think you've all seen this sketch before! It's an exact drawing of what he witnessed that night!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">......</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... ...Are you serious? Today's not April Fools' Day, is it? Mr. Wright. Are you seriously claiming that the victim flew through the air!? And you're using this pathetic scribble to support your argument!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh-oh... The judge looks like he's about to blow a gasket.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Well, Trite. There's nowhere for you to hide now... Other than looking like it was drawn by a 6 year old, does this sketch prove anything?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes... I'm pretty sure it does, and I'm going to prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Listen... I know your tricks. You're trying to turn this whole thing upside-down.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you're so eager to turn this case upside-down, why not start with this sketch?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Upside-down...? Why did Godot say that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It all comes back to this!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I can't believe we're looking at this again...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I admit that I didn't really understand it before... But I get it now! That's why I believe this sketch shows the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well.</line>

<line speaker="Godot">Rethinking why you became a lawyer? Perhaps you'd like to rethink merely being born!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no! I'm not going that far back...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Or are you saying that there is a way to cross a burning bridge?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Well, I don't see why there couldn't be a way across!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mr. Wright... Don't you think that sounds a bit silly?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">A dead body crossing a burning bridge... Did anyone actually witness such a thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! If there was, I don't think you'd call someone like that a witness! After all, a dream isn't the same as actually seeing something...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A dead body flying over a burning bridge... I wouldn't exactly rule out the possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You're saying it's possible? Don't make me laugh. The only thing that's possible about your claim is that it's been pulled out of thin air!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't know about that. In any case... We have a witness who did see it happen.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Pwweposterous!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Who is it!? Who is this witness!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I can't chicken out here... I've gotta keep on the attack and go, go, go!</thought> Ms. Elise Deauxnim's brilliant and highly-gifted apprentice, Laurice Deauxnim!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Brilliant...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Highly-gifted...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Apprentice...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Remember what he said in his testimony. That night he was at the mountain shack, Heavenly Hall. And that's when he witnessed the event. I think you've all seen this sketch before! It's an exact drawing of what he witnessed that night!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">......</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... ...Are you serious? Today's not April Fools' Day, is it? Mr. Wright. Are you seriously claiming that the victim flew through the air!? And you're using this pathetic scribble to support your argument!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh-oh... The judge looks like he's about to blow a gasket.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Well, Trite. There's nowhere for you to hide now... Other than looking like it was drawn by a 6 year old, does this sketch prove anything?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes... I'm pretty sure it does, and I'm going to prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Listen... I know your tricks. You're trying to turn this whole thing upside-down.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you're so eager to turn this case upside-down, why not start with this sketch?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Upside-down...? Why did Godot say that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It all comes back to this!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I can't believe we're looking at this again...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I admit that I didn't really understand it before... But I get it now! That's why I believe this sketch shows the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory. What exactly is this sketch trying to show?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't think old whisker-face is going to forgive any more mistakes! Alright, Phoenix. Look carefully and think it over!</thought> This sketch drawn by Laurice Deauxnim is...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This sketch proves exactly one thing! ...Absolutely nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... I've been a judge for a long time now... But I've never seen a defense lawyer so brazenly admit the flimsiness of their evidence! I must say it was quite refreshing in a strange way.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Times change, Your Honor. ...Like they say, you are quite the old man, Old Man.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...I have a feeling my own life span just got shorter.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Allow me to speed you along the aging process, Trite!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Of course the victim was flying through the air! You can see it right there in the sketch! ...Whooooosh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... You know... You're starting to remind me of yesterday's witness.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Whhhhhhhaaaaa!? <thought>That was the last thing I wanted to hear...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do you have any evidence that the victim flew through the air!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Just so you know... We haven't discovered a giant human catapult at the Inner Temple yet.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uggh... I wish they had.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Even if you're a lousy lawyer, at least you're one cup's worth of entertainment. I think we should skip the penalty this time.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nnnnrgh... <thought>There must be some way. I just know it... There must be a way to use Larry's sketch to show the truth of what happened...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Something is obviously funny about this sketch!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... I'm no art critic, but even I can see that!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no! That's not what I mean, Your Honor. Laurice Deauxnim stated it over and over... That this sketch was exactly as he saw it. ...However! If we're to believe his testimony... ...then the sketch contradicts reality as we know it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It contradicts reality...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! This is getting interesting. Looks like you're back to that finger-pointing thing again. OK, Trite. So what exactly contradicts reality as we know it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This flying figure, naturally! After all, people haven't learned to fly yet... Or did I miss something?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Mr. Wright. That answer just now... It was lethal.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! After dragging us all the way to this point, that answer was embarrassing!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It was so embarrassing, I'm actually blushing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Blushing only suits women, not the elderly. Anyway, what now...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I've decided to rethink the whole thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That sounds like a wise idea.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Rethinking why you became a lawyer? Perhaps you'd like to rethink merely being born!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no! I'm not going that far back...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! Please give me one more chance! <thought>I'm in a tight spot now... What I really need to do is turn this case upside-down... So it's time for me to flip things around and get them straight again in my head...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Do you know what you're saying this time?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe it's somewhere... around here... Maybe.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">"Somewhere"...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">"Around here"...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">"Maybe"...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... Well, the artist responsible for this sketch is a bit of a walking contradiction. So it's difficult to point out where the contradictions end and the truth begins...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Enough with the psycho-babble! Mr. Wright! After dragging us all the way to this point, that answer was embarrassing! It was so embarrassing, I'm actually blushing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Blushing only suits women, not the elderly. Anyway, what now...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I've decided to rethink the whole thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That sounds like a wise idea.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Rethinking why you became a lawyer? Perhaps you'd like to rethink merely being born!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no! I'm not going that far back...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! Please give me one more chance! <thought>I'm in a tight spot now... What I really need to do is turn this case upside-down... So it's time for me to flip things around and get them straight again in my head...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Do you know what you're saying this time?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's this wire connected to the bridge!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...The wire?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Is that the thing that contradicts reality?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It is indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Then show us the reality it supposedly conflicts with. Show us something that will point out how the sketch contradicts reality!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Here's your evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite... It looks like the only piece of reality you have is that poorly drawn sketch.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">And the only thing flying away here is your chance of winning this case!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I guess I just don't get it yet. I still don't understand what the truth behind this sketch is.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr. Wright? If you want to think it over, now is your chance.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I'm still not too sure... But I'm certain I'm in the right ballpark! Somehow this wire is the key to explaining things!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I've decided to rethink the whole thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That sounds like a wise idea.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Rethinking why you became a lawyer? Perhaps you'd like to rethink merely being born!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no! I'm not going that far back...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I've come all this way, so I owe it to everyone to figure this out... But how do you transport a body across a burning bridge...? Even if I don't know the exact answer yet, it's OK. I'll start by examining all of my evidence, and see where that takes me... I've gotta be like a shark... If I don't keep moving, I'm as good as dead!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's a photo of Dusky Bridge, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes. Now, compare the sketch and the photo for a minute. In the sketch, the wires appear to be above the guard wires. But on the actual Dusky Bridge...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Jumping Jehosaphat!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The wires are... below the guard wires!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Bwhaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Order! This sketch is somewhat different than what's depicted in the photo! However... Isn't it likely that the artist just saw it wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Or perhaps he just drew it wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Either way, it sounds like you're... just wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...With someone like Laurice, I admit a mistake is a definite possibility. But then that begs the question... "Why did he make a mistake?" What was the reason?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Are you saying you know the answer to that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Listen! Think back, alright? Remember what Laurice was doing when he witnessed this event. ...He was at Heavenly Hall waiting for a lover that was never going to come. He waited and waited, and finally he laid down. ...But then! Lightning shoots from the sky and sets the bridge aflame! Now ponder what sort of position Larry must have been in at the time... He was lying on his back, which is why he remembered the scene the way he did.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... He was lying on his back...? I can't see how it relates...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But it does, Your Honor. That is the reason why the wires in the sketch go up instead of down...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Aaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ugh... No way...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Laurice Deauxnim witnessed the event while he was lying on his back, face up. In other words, the scene that he saw... ...was actually upside-down!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then...! This sketch should actually...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think you finally get it, Your Honor. The correct way to view Laurice Deauxnim's sketch is like this! This is how it should actually look! The victim's body wasn't flying above the bridge! It was actually swinging below! ...That's right! Just like a pendulum!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Bwwweeeediculous!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Order--</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Of all the things to say! A pendulum!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...The bridge was burning to a crisp. There was no way to get across it. But if the body had been found at the Inner Temple, it would have caused problems. This is where the criminal decided to take a gamble. They used the burning bridge to get the body across to the other side. And a pendulum was the only way to get it done!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Let's think about this for a minute, shall we? Dusky Bridge is about 20 yards long. Which means it's about that far from the Inner Temple to the opposite cliff.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Yes, that sounds right.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">In order to cover that distance with a pendulum... You'd need a rope at least 10 yards long. To get a rope that long, you have to plan ahead!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>The lightning strike that night can only have been an accident. So it doesn't make sense that the criminal would have prepared the rope beforehand. So then, the criminal...</thought> They didn't have to get the rope ready... The rope was already right in front of the criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm saying that it was just a matter of using what was already there.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In that case, Mr. Wright, please give us an explanation to support your theory. What makes you think the criminal had the rope on hand to create a pendulum!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">... What do you think, Mr. Godot?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I think that Mr. Trite is lucky there's no rope around here...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Even if I had just a sliver of rope... ...I'd be wrapping it nice and tight around his neck.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I should have figured I'm not going to win this one with a lucky guess...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, your assertion seems to be baseless...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There's no evidence that the body was swung like a pendulum after all...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait! But that's the only possible way the body could have gotten across!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And the meaning of this is...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If you want to know where the rope came from... ...it's hanging right there in front of your glorious beard!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Aaaaaaaah! This... This is one of the wires from the bridge!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">When the lightning struck the bridge and set it on fire... ...one of the suspension wires came loose from its anchor. The criminal didn't have any time to waste. So they tied the wire around Elise Deauxnim's body... ...because there was simply no other way to move the body!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...... Ha......! *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug*</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Godot!? Hmm... It seems that Mr. Godot is more focused on his coffee than answering my question. It seems that the odds of a rope being readily available were very high. So I suppose that it's not an impossibility after all!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">"Possible" or "impossible"...? That's not the question we need to ask! There's only one question. "Did that really happen?" Trite! I wonder if you can prove what happened to us. Do you have any actual evidence that the body was swung over like a pendulum!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Here's the proof!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Why don't you go swing yourself around like a pendulum, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I think you should think that over again, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...It's kinda nice when they don't spend too much time thinking of a witty retort.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">I suppose we've gotten used to your mistakes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I need to think about how this body was moved... The criminal decided to use the pendulum method as a last resort... So there's a good chance there's still a clue from when or where the body landed.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Here's a toast to your ever so classic clueless-look.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Before I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far. According to this photo, one of the wires snapped. Looking at the map, we can see it's the one that was in front of the Inner Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then, that was the spot where the criminal...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, precisely. Now let us consider the body's movement by looking at the overhead map again. If the body was pushed from this point here... ...it would drop on the opposite bank at approximately this point.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">D-Did you say drop?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, they must have failed to catch the body on the other bank.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What...!? What makes you think something like that happened!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Because I have evidence that suggests her body dropped some distance.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Wh-What kind of evidence!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Take a look at this autopsy report. It says here that her body fell about 10 feet after her death.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ten feet, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's most likely the height difference between the two sides. The body over swung due to forward momentum but then came loose and fell about 10 feet. And then, as a result of the landing impact... ...this crystal sphere was knocked loose!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...! That's...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, this blood-stained amethyst crystal... It's the one that came off of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff! And even more important is the place where this crystal sphere was found!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In-Indeed... I believe it's already marked on this overhead map. The crystal was found... Aaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Precisely, Your Honor. In the very spot where the pendulum would arrive if given the right amount of speed!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This explains your theory quite well, Mr. Wright. You have provided us with a way the body could have been moved that night... An impressive deduction, Mr. Wright. ...Most impressive. M-Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I thought this cold coffee might help cool you down.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh... What is the meaning of this, Mr. Godot!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That was a dark and bitter guess that you made, Trite. ...But you forgot about one thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh? And what would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... The aroma.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">A coffee's most reliable accomplice is its deep and profound aroma...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um... The rest of the court doesn't speak Coffeenese. Can you elaborate a bit more?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If the criminal had sent the body to the other side like you say... ...then naturally, there must have been an accomplice laying in wait to catch it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">An accomplice...!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...The criminal wasn't able to cross Dusky Bridge. So, who collected the body...? What do you have to say about that, Trite!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Godot is correct... This can't be the work of a single person! Well, Mr. Wright!? You know what you must do.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Yes, Your Honor. <thought>The body couldn't have made it to Hazakura Temple without an accomplice!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well then! If you please, Mr. Wright. Who was the person that received the body on the Hazakura Temple side?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot? I'm sure you have something to say.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That aroma just now... It smelled of sulfur... Perhaps it was your chances of winning rotting away?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I can't get my facts all mixed up like this! After the accomplice received the body, they carried it to Hazakura Temple... Then they altered it using the Shichishito! There's only one person it can be...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Mr. Wright. Please don't stare at me like that. It's creepy.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It can only be you... Sister Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Huh...? Aaaaaaah! But I... I...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I don't see why you're so surprised. The only way to transport the body from Dusky Bridge is by snowmobile. But with her bad back, Sister Bikini could never pick up a body like that. ...You're the only one that could have managed it.</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite. Were you even listening to the witness's testimony...? On the night of the crime, this little cutie pie... ...was on clean-up duty in the Inner Temple Garden after the mother-daughter bloodbath.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I haven't forgotten. But have you, Mr. Godot? This witness was also seen at Hazakura Temple... ...desecrating the corpse of the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Strange indeed... It's almost as if... ...on that night, the defendant was in two different places at the same time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Sister Iris. Let me ask you something... Why didn't you mention it when you first gave your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">M-Mention what?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The pendulum, of course. Using this sketch drawn by an eyewitness... I have established how the body was moved using the burnt-out bridge. Which means it's now a fact that this occurred, something you should've already known.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">N-No...! I... I had no idea! I-I didn't know anything about a pendulum!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But the body couldn't have been passed along to the other side without your help! So you should have known about it! In fact, it'd be impossible for you to be clueless about this whole thing... ...unless you're not really Iris to begin with.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What...!? H-How can you say that, Mr. Wright...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What...!? What kind of nonsense is this? You... You're saying this witness isn't Iris of Hazakura Temple...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">A-Are you serious, Trite...!? You... You mean... Th-This woman is...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>There's no one besides Iris that could have received the corpse that night! Now I get it... Now I know why I've been sick to my stomach during this trial. Why her whole demeanor changed so suddenly from yesterday... ...and why she's trying to pin this murder on Maya...</thought> The woman that's standing there at the witness stand... Her real name is...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No, wait! That can't be it! This is no time to be making stupid, amateurish mistakes!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! You've just made an absolutely absurd accusation! I won't have you turning my courtroom into a circus side-show!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uuurgh...! <thought>Come on! This one's a no-brainer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I never thought I'd have to utter your name again... Let alone see you. ...It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hawthorne...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sister Iris had a twin sister. ...And you're looking at her. Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...... That name rings some bells. Distant bells, but bells nonetheless...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! It's just your imagination, gramps. This file contains all the relevant data about Dahlia Hawthorne.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Oh yes, I remember now... That case... 5 years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.</line>
<line speaker="Payne">The honor is all mine!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No... The honor is all mine.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But... According to this... Dahlia Hawthorne... ...is already dead! ...It says her execution was carried out last month!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... So what? Death has no meaning in this courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!? Order! Order! Order!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">W-Wait a moment! How can you...? My sister...! She's already dead! Wh-What kind of...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...You of all people should already understand. After all... The blood of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique flows within that body.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The Kurain Channeling Technique...? Now where have I heard that...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...That's right. You're not Dahlia Hawthorne herself. You're the spirit of Dahlia, currently inhabiting the body of a spirit medium!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">What an exciting story. Exciting, but quite impossible. You're asking us to buy that Dahlia Hawthorne just happened to be channeled by someone... ...on the very night of the murder, to a temple where her twin sister, Iris was...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, if you're going to put things that way, then... Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">We're supposed to believe a coincidence like that just happens!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Naturally it was no coincidence. The whole thing was part of a plan from the very beginning. It's all written right here in these instructions...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...! Wh-What's that...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">These instructions were written by your mother, Morgan Fey! And part of the plan called for Dahlia Hawthorne to be channeled! That night... ...there were two Irises at Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...T-Two of them?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Even the time of the channeling was planned out. "As soon as you hear the lights out bell"... In other words, 10:00 PM. However, Iris was seen before dinnertime.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That means the Iris that was at dinner was the real Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And the Iris who gave me this hood in the Main Hall was also the real Iris. Meaning that the Iris Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple... ...was someone else dressed as her! Namely, one Dahlia Hawthorne!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Do you even know what you're saying, Trite? This whole "channeling the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne" business... Yes, it's true that you found plans that talk about it. ...However! There's one thing that's perfectly clear. The witness currently standing in the witness stand is the real Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Whaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Calm down and remember what you know about the night of the crime. After meeting Sister Bikini, the Dahlia Hawthorne that had been channeled... ...would've been stranded at the Inner Temple due to the lightning strike. It was later that the body was moved by pendulum.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Naturally that would mean that the Iris that received the body was... ...the real Iris. Are you with me so far?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">After being notified of what happened, the police came to Hazakura Temple's Main Hall. There they found Iris in her room and arrested her. And ever since, she's been under police supervision at the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes, I suppose... <thought>I can't deny any of that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Whew... Thank goodness. It looks like he's finally convinced...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>But something still seems off... Way off...!</thought> I'm still not convinced that the Iris here is the same one from the other night.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! I suppose you're about to say something really ridiculous? Like, the real Iris and the spirit of Dahlia... ...somehow switched places?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-Switched places...!? To be perfectly honest... ...there are still quite a few things I don't understand, but I do know... ...that unless we confirm the witness's identity, we can't continue with this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Iris doesn't have the spiritual power needed to channel Dahlia. Which means... ...they must have switched places somewhere.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr. Wright? Since the time she was arrested at Hazakura Temple... ...have there been any chances for Iris to switch places with Dahlia Hawthorne?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... <thought>Hmm, I can't think of one... She certainly couldn't have escaped while she was under arrest!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! I love that look on your face! Maybe you should go live in that old mountain shack and become a hermit?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It appears there was no opportunity for them to have switched places.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No! If I give up here, I'd never be able to live with myself... Even if it's a little forced, I have to think of something!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Your Honor! I think there might have been one chance.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh? Explain yourself...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yesterday for a few minutes, Iris's whereabouts were unknown.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Unknown...? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What I mean is... There was a span of time in which Iris was able to move about freely, unsupervised.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, who was it!? Who would give a murder suspect time to move about freely like that!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I'm sorry... I know you didn't mean to... It wasn't your fault...</thought> The person who gave Iris the chance to freely move about was...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Mr. Wright. There will be no unaccountability in my court, time or otherwise!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Trite, Trite, Trite... Can't you even remember what happened only yesterday...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Yesterday, Iris was escorted to Hazakura Temple... ...in order to remove the locks on the Sacred Cavern! That would have been her only chance...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This is... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't it...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Your Honor. There was a fairly large earthquake yesterday, was there not?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">An... earthquake? Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">E-Earthquake! Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H-How could I have...? She fled... She escaped!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We went to the Inner Temple right away. And it's true, Iris was already there. However... ...they had already switched places by that point in time. When I arrived at the Training Hall, I was met by none other than Dahlia Hawthorne!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-That's quite enough already, Mr. Wright! Now see here! No judge in his right mind would consider the idea of "spirit channeling" and...</line>
<line speaker="???">...Be quiet. It's been a long time... Mr. Judge.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...! Th-That voice...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Guess I'll have to ask again.</line>
<line speaker="???">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Dahlia Hawthorne. And my current profession? Permanently retired.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! So you're not going to bother hiding your identity anymore, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...Why should I? After all, I'm dead. There's really nothing you can do to punish me!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What is going on here...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Dahlia Hawthorne... I never thought we'd meet again. And I never thought we'd meet like this... But this time, I'll end it! For her, and for myself...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Now then, let's continue where we left off, shall we? Well, witness?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes? How can I help you? ...Mr. Judge.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well... It seems that if we're to learn the truth... ...we'll need to hear your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... I have no problem with that. But when you've seen what I have, sometimes the truth is better left unknown.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...In any case, let's hear your testimony! Tell us about the plan that was carried out that night!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...The whole plan began with my death.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So that means... Y-You really are...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait a minute! Did you just say the plan was to kill Maya Fey...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes. You have a problem with that...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't give us that nonsense! There's no way that--</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Watch yourself, Trite! If you've got a problem, solve it during cross-examination! ...That's my rule.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Godot is correct! And by the way... that's my rule as well!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>To kill Maya...? Could it be true!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...The whole plan began with my death.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You were executed last month, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes. I was hanged. It wasn't exactly... pleasant.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How did you manage to discuss the plan? When did you talk with Morgan Fey?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Last year, she was transferred to the same detention center as me. Since I was on death row and she was my mother... ...it was actually pretty easy to meet with her.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see... So that's when you discussed the plan?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...Ha! Are you crazy? At first, that woman was planning to kill me as well! ...Even though I'm her own daughter.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All to make Pearl Fey the Master of Kurain...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">She's a cold, twisted woman. She thought she could finally regain her lost honor. The honor she lost when her younger sister, Misty, took her place as the Master. Ever since that day, she's been working on this plan.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... A plan, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then tell me! Why!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What did you say...!? <thought>So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">A stupid plan hatched by Morgan Fey to install her own daughter as the next Master.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're talking about Pearl Fey, is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes, though at first she had high hopes for the two of us.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You and your twin sister, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">That's correct. Fortunately, neither of us had much spiritual power. That's why... we were abandoned by her... along with our father.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A-Abandoned...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">The only person I ever really cared about in life was myself... My sister was a nuisance, so I convinced my father to leave her at an old temple.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You mean Iris...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...Yes, my father remarried a woman who also had a daughter. The less children you have, the more money there is to go around, right? And on top of that, my father had absolutely no interest in children in general.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H... How horrible...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">The real horrible one was that woman... That bitter, vengeful woman. It was her stubbornness that gave birth to that child... Pearl Fey. She was born with an abundance of spiritual power. ...Unfortunately for her. Morgan Fey heaped all of her broken hopes and dreams on to that poor child's back. All because of her pathetic dreams of having her bloodline become the main family.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then tell me! Why!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What did you say...!? <thought>So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">But for it to work... Maya Fey would first have to die.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya would have to die!? But why!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">For our bloodline to succeed as the main family, thus making Pearl the new Master... ...the remaining descendants of the current Master had to be taken care of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But Pearls would never agree to a plan like that! She adores Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...How sad. You still don't get it, do you? What Pearl wanted had nothing to do with it. Morgan didn't care one bit about Pearl. The only thing she cared about was the position of the Master. That's all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's ridiculous...!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">She was willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve her goal. The life of her daughter... and naturally, the life of Maya Fey as well.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>How could anyone do that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then tell me! Why!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What did you say...!? <thought>So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">The idea was for me to kill Maya and then have the blame pinned on Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You...? You were going to kill Maya?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Pearl didn't need to know anything about it... All she had to do was to follow the instructions in the letter and channel me. Then I would have simply used her body and finished the job. In any case... I'm already dead, and there's nothing any of you can do to me...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Grrrr...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">So the plan was to blame the crime on your younger sister. On Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">She and I look absolutely identical. No one can tell us apart. If someone were to witness me killing Maya... ...naturally they would think it was Iris that had done it.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">And the witness in this case was the head nun, Sister Bikini.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I never would've guessed she was going to return to Hazakura Temple that night. But... she wound up seeing Iris's "crime" anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But why did you want to pin the murder on Iris in the first place!? She's your twin sister, isn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Twin sister...!? Don't make me laugh! She's nothing but a backstabber. I couldn't care less about her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Backstabber...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">You just don't understand. ...You never will. Anyway...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then tell me! Why!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What did you say...!? <thought>So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">The plan went wrong... but it seems to have succeeded anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You think the plan was a success?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">You heard me. Just as that woman had hoped... ...Maya Fey is dead. Now the title of the Master will pass on to Pearl Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's absurd! M-Maya is just... She's just trapped! Trapped inside the Sacred Cavern!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Really...? You're as foolishly optimistic as ever, aren't you... my darling Feenie?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Do you want to know the truth? Ever since we met... I've despised you. Your sniveling naïveté and your pathetic faith in other people.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then tell me! Why!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What did you say...!? <thought>So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Do you understand why I would kill Maya Fey now? What my goal was?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Obviously... It's because you were helping Morgan Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Helping...? Don't make me laugh. From the day I was born to the day I died, I never helped anyone! I lived for myself and, in the end, I died for myself. I thought that was obvious.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So she wasn't actually cooperating with Morgan... She was just using Morgan and her plan so she could accomplish her own goal!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">All I wanted to do was kill Maya Fey. That was the only way I could think of to get revenge...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Revenge...? It looks like I have no choice but to present that piece of evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I can't believe it! She meant to kill Maya... I've got to keep a cool head! And... I need to get more information out of her. It's the only way to understand this plan, and what she was after as well!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Could it be... ...that your actual goal had nothing to do with Maya Fey herself...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...As I said, none of you have the power to punish me anymore. Because I'm already dead. Well, I had the same problem, you see. You can't punish the dead... and you can't take revenge against them either.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-You wanted to take revenge on someone?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I was sentenced to die because of that woman... Mia Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I somehow knew this was it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...I wanted to send her a message. It was at her hands that I suffered my first humiliation... I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">And the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey had already died...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A-And how do you do that?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... As they say, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Grrrr...!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So... it was Elise Deauxnim who channeled her after all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What did you do then...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">That kid was easier to handle than I had hoped... I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-So then you... Y-You're saying you s-stabbed Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...What does that mean!? No clear memory...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I don't know... I think... I think I was stabbed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You were stabbed!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">At the last minute, Maya Fey must have stabbed me. I'm sure of it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote "Maya" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I-I can't believe she was thinking of that until the bitter end...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...That's where my memory temporarily stops.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It-It stops...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You were in the Sacred Cavern?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But how did you wind up in there?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The trick lock stopped you, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I didn't know how to remove it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Interrupted...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">It was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What!? Who!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Could it have been... Maya!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why not!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...The flies had already started to gather.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Lady Luck...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...The real Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you mean your plan had succeeded?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey... The picture book author...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And that is...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">It's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the murderer who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">R-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Are you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even evidence supporting these facts, isn't there?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Where...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Do I have to spell it out? ...The bottom of the Eagle River, where else?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ea-Eagle River...!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ooooh... Uuuuuhhhh...</line>
<line speaker="Phone">.........</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What kind of ringtone is that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phone">...*beep*...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Godot here. ......... ...OK. Thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Phone">...*beep*...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Was it something important?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">They just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's great! What about Maya?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... There was a woman in the cave...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Was it Maya Fey...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It was the accused... Sister Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Don't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So... what about Maya? Where is she?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">N-No... It can't be...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I told you, didn't I? She's dead.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It can't be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite... Have you ever heard this one? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth." ...No matter how improbable it may seem.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">According to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Remember, this woman testified earlier that... ...the bridge was already on fire when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the Inner Temple side, near the bridge.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">That's right! That's where she jumped from...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But that's impossible. It's impossible to jump into the river from there!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...! <thought>Wh-What...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So it's impossible...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...That's it? That's your answer?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! The only one that should be thrown into a river is you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugh...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But then again... Even if you did... ...you wouldn't reach the river, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Huh...? What's that...? I wouldn't reach it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side... No one knows that better than this witness!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">What did you say...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Eleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just take a look at this overhead map! As you can see... ...below the cliff on the Inner Temple side is a big rock shelf!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She wouldn't have reached the river if she had jumped off from there. In other words... If she had jumped, we should be able to see her body in this photo!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! So you finally figured it out!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">You...! Nooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">O-Order! Order!!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">You... You're just playing with me! Maya Fey's body is at the bottom of the Eagle River! There's nowhere else she could possibly be hiding!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Hawthorne... Have you ever heard this one before? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth."</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Yes, just a few minutes ago.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Maya Fey wasn't inside the Sacred Cavern. We now know that she didn't throw herself into the Eagle River.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now, although it seems improbable, there's still one other place she could be.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh... What...!? What is this one possibility you are talking about...?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Th-That's obviously a bluff! So where is her dead body then?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Finally... I think the pieces are falling into place... Normally the living have no way to punish the dead... But I think there is a way to give Dahlia Hawthorne the ultimate punishment.</thought> ...Shall I tell you, Ms. Hawthorne? Shall I tell you where Maya is this very instant!? Maya Fey is...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The Inner Temple was cut off from the outside world on the night of the crime. So in other words, Maya is still there!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The police scoured the Inner Temple from top to bottom, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You bet. Detective Gumshoe had his nose to the ground and sniffed around everywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then the fact that Maya is not in the Inner Temple... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's already been proven that she isn't on the Inner Temple side! So that means... she must be somewhere in Hazakura Temple!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The bridge was already on fire when the murder took place, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Just so you know, my heart is also on fire and it aches from your stupidity.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So the impossibility of Maya Fey escaping from the Inner Temple side... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's only one possibility left. Namely... she's right here in this very courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Wh-What!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">M-Maya Fey is here!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You say she's here in m-my courtroom!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Dahlia Hawthorne. I seem to recall that you said... "I had misunderstood one thing, you see."</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">So what!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But I think there's one more thing you misunderstood.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">What do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Tell me something. At this very moment... ...who is channeling Dahlia Hawthorne!?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Wh-Why that... that's obvious! It's Pearl Fey! That pathetic, little, sniveling runt!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...You're wrong. Pearls tried... but she couldn't do it.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Isn't there any explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit?</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">... It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Someone called me before Pearl did...? But who...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Pearls even tried again on the day after the crime. But she couldn't do it... What could that mean? I think the truth is becoming clearer to you right about now, am I correct?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">... Aaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It wasn't Pearls that channeled you! There was someone who called you before she could!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No, that's not who! How can I come this far and still not get it!? Pearls couldn't channel her. And Maya had disappeared... There's only one possible answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! You can mumble to yourself like a wino on your own time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">P-Please... Give me just one more chance...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...This is an easy one. Pearls couldn't do it, and Misty Fey is gone. There's only one possibility left!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Come on already...! I can't stand the tension!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Dahlia Hawthorne! The person channeling you right now must be... Maya Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Wh... WHAAAAAAAT!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But how could that be!? Remember what this witness, Dahlia Hawthorne, said about her goal!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">She said that her goal was to kill Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, that's right. But if Maya channeled the spirit of someone that was trying to kill her...! ...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Well, gramps? What would happen?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... C-Could it be...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It looks like you finally understand, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">W-Well, I don't! What are you going on about!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What I'm going on about is the reason Maya channeled you... And there's only one reason. To protect herself from you!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">To... protect herself... ...from me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes. On the night of the crime, you were only interested in one thing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The path to the Inner Temple was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run. So then the problem became... "Where would be the safest place to hide?"</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Ah... Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You mean... That's when she channeled me...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All along you thought you had been channeled by Pearls... That's why it never occurred to you... ...that Maya's hiding place... ...was you!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">N-No... No... DON'T SAY THAT! Y-You're saying that I... ...was played for a fool!? By that little whelp!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Maya Fey killed herself! Isn't it obvious!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sorry, but no... It would have been impossible for her to jump into the Eagle River. ...This was the only avenue of escape open to Maya. The only way that Maya could disappear from the Inner Temple...!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I-I don't believe you...! A stupid little girl like that who has never been out in the real world... She could never have come up with a plan like that! Who could have ever given her such a brilliant idea!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... Well...</line>
<line speaker="???">...Me, of course...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M... Mia!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Mia Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... ...So it's true... It was you.</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You're something else...</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">B-But what... what are you doing here...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That hair... It's Pearls, right?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Tell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you lost consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I was stabbed! By Maya Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Actually... Maya lost consciousness at the same time as you.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...She did?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Not terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she channeled me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">She did that...? I can't believe it...</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Of course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And that was...?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">I knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Free...? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">It was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. Channel Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and lock herself in the Sacred Cavern until help arrived.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So it was Maya who put that lock on there...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, but why did you order her to do those two things?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">If she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by someone else. By one Pearl Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">P-Pearls?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Yes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">H-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Yes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Wh-What do you mean by another!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Think about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">What...!? How dare you...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Sh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And then... one year later. You tried to kill me.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">You...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...... True.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">But I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Wh-What...!? What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Whether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">Grrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already dead.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">What about it!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Then you said... "Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever."</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the punishment you'll never be able to escape from.</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">For all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Nick... ...Sis...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then... I assume you are the real Iris...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The tragedy of "Medium Valley" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ Umm... Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, what is it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">About this whole "spirit medium" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!"!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... My brother and I used to differ.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm, never thought of it that way...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">This trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-What!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Dahlia's testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and... ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think I was stabbed.</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and "killed" by someone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes... That's right...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... who killed her? We still don't know who did it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-This isn't over!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Unless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">N-No way...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The prosecution is ready to call our final witness!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">F-Final... witness!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of "Who killed Misty Fey"!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Hmm, indeed!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then... Who is this final witness?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-Someone who saw the murder take place...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You mean... Maya!? ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">We need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You've got some nerve!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough! This court is now in recess!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...She's right. When I met "Iris" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had already switched places... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">But... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Some people...? You must mean...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, two defense lawyers. Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...That's right...</thought> ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, what is it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">On the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Phone">......... ...*beep*...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Phone">......... ...*beep*...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It was me... I was the one that received her body. The murder weapon had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The staff that Mystic Elise always held...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But why... Why did you alter the body?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The real killer.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... I... I see...</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">...Defendant!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Y-Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">The judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you later.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, um... OK... <thought>"Something she wants to tell me"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real killer... Maybe even from the very beginning!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mia">...Phoenix.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Mia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Physically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...But why?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">Maya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">I want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.</thought> That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer knew of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal couldn't cross the bridge. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Exactly. So the criminal... ...was someone that wasn't in Hazakura Temple the following day...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mia">... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">OK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Tests...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh yeah! That! <thought>I totally forgot about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">That's the weapon that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Due to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So it wasn't Misty's blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I understand, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">From what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Agreed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well! Please bring in the last witness!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Witness, please tell us your name and profession.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Maya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">According to the magazine I have here... ...you're a spirit medium of the Kurain Channeling Technique...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Oh, Maya... The pain the Fey bloodline causes must be unbearable...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well. Now then, Ms. Fey. When the event occurred... you were in the garden of the Inner Temple. And... You witnessed the moment of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. ...Is this correct?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Straighten up this moment, young lady!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Pick your head up and speak clearly. There's always time for crying later.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">B-But I...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Your mother was killed right in front of your eyes! There's nothing you can do to change that fact.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But there's something you can do... You can finish this. You've been watching the whole thing right? You've seen the witnesses come out and you've seen us squeeze the truth out of them. Now it's your turn. ...Let's hear your testimony. On the night of the crime... what exactly did you see happen!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witness. If you please.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya, think hard...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... <thought>Maya... Hang in there... She doesn't look well at all...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Who else was on the Inner Temple side that night?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she couldn't be the criminal.</thought> So then... did Iris actually come later like she said?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, umm... Let me think...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">No... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Who did it? Who hit you?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You didn't see the person...? But after that, your attacker was in front of you! How could you not see who it was!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh! L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya is really having a hard time... What should I do?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Considering the conditions at the crime scene... ...it's not surprising she didn't see her attacker.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! So it looks like even you've got some compassion.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Come on, Maya, this isn't making sense. Why didn't you see this person?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm, well, let me think... It was... Uh... Oh yeah! That's right! It was dark, that's it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It was dark...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Which is why she didn't see her attacker... I thought maybe she was trying to hide something, but I guess not...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...The spirit that was channeled by Elise Deauxnim... Dahlia Hawthorne!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Very well, please continue with your testimony. What happened after you were struck on the head...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What happened afterwards!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">My attacker was in front of me, blocking off my escape. ...I think.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You... think...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">After getting hit like that... I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well now...! This is beginning to get interesting!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So what were the two things rolling around in your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm... "My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two"...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">You see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's not odd at all. Your actions are understandable, given the circumstances. So... What did you do then?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I think I screamed, "Help me!"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You think you screamed, but you're not sure?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by "last hope"... What do I do? Do I press her for more details...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So you're certain that you screamed, "Help me!"?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Is it all that strange, Trite, for her to have screamed, "Help me"?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No, but... Something about that bugs me... Why would you face someone that's trying to kill you... ...and go through the trouble of screaming for help?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh. Um... OK.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait a minute, Maya. What's this "my last hope" stuff?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um, what...? What do you mean by "your last hope"?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no, no! That's what you said...! You said, "my last hope."</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh? What? I said what?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... Look, you were facing an attacker that you couldn't see and you screamed, right? You screamed, "Help me!"</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um, yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But you testified that you screamed that because you thought it was your last hope.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya's not doing so well up there...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What did you just say...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at. That's who I was screaming to for help! ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What is it now!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I messed up! I didn't... I didn't mean to let that slip out...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Witness! Are you absolutely sure of what you're saying? Behind the attacker... There was another person!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um, I am... Well... I uhh, I meant to keep that part a secret. Nngh... What have I done?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! "It takes a ton of pressure to make a diamond." That's what I always say.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">A ton of pressure...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...You're in a court of law here! You can't make things up or try to hide things in this chamber.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Witness. The information you just presented is vital to the case. I want you to add it to your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya is really emotionally and physically exhausted. I shouldn't go overboard. For the time being, I'll just play it by ear.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh. Um... OK.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Maya">I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A man? Who was this man?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">W-Well... Y-You see... I-I couldn't see.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You couldn't see...? <thought>She's used this excuse twice now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lantern light, did you say?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">H-Hey! You know what they say... "Under the lantern, darkness reigns." So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Maya">Then something warm splashed over me...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You don't mean...! W-Was it...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Is she saying that's when Ms. Deauxnim, who was channeling Dahlia... ...was stabbed in the back by the killer?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's when... I lost consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So what happened next?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...I don't remember.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">How were you saved? You don't even remember that?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That's too bad.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I've worked side by side with Maya for 3 years now. When she hides something, I can tell by how she acts. And right now... I'm absolutely certain she's hiding something!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm... yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That man... He's the killer. He stabbed her from behind. He's the one who killed Elise Deauxnim... Otherwise known as... Misty Fey, your mother.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">The killer...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya... You know who killed your mother, don't you.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">To be frank, Your Honor, I think she is in shock and quite confused. That's why she hasn't noticed the huge problem with her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">H-Huh? What do you mean? What problem...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Maya. On the night of the crime... that stone lantern was out of commission.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh... What!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...It's true. There was no light anywhere in the garden that night.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N-No!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! M-Mr. Godot! Explain this!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Add the pureness of milk to the perfect, clear darkness of coffee. Stir. That is the state of the witness's mind right now -- a cup of café au lait.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">C-Café o' Lay? Is that even legal...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Mr. Trite's words are the milk and you are the spoon, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-I'm a spoon!? I'm no spoony bard, I'll have you know!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You must have noticed it too, Trite. ...This witness's mental state is highly unstable right now. It's not hard to understand why she would make a little mistake like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sorry, but that's not going to cut it!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If there truly was no light in the garden... ...then there's a fatal contradiction in the witness's last bit of testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N-Nick...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...May I? Recall the witness's statement about her attacker. She said that she didn't know if it was a man or a woman, an adult or a child. ...And yet! The witness could describe a person that was standing behind her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a man!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...In other words! That would have to mean that Maya actually saw our mystery person! Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of the attacker in front of her!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N... NOOOOOOOOOO!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Or-Order! Order! Order! What in the world does this all mean, Mr. Wright!? Are you saying Ms. Fey saw the real killer under pitch black conditions!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Trite! Do you have any idea what you're proposing? How could she have seen in the dark? There was no other light source at the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There are some things that you can only see in the dark, Mr. Godot.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya, you did see who the killer was in the dark. And now... you're trying to cover for him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">C-Cover...!? For the man that killed her mother...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's only one conclusion I can draw from this... You know who this man is!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...... ... Please... Nick... I don't know anything... Please... I'm begging you...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Ha! You talk a good game, Trite. But let's see if you can walk the walk. It was pitch black. So what could the witness see? I'm calling your bluff!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N-No, Nick! Don't...! P-Please! Stop...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya is dead set on protecting this guy... The man who murdered Maya's long-lost mother...! But... I can't let him get away with it. I'm a lawyer. An officer of the court. I'm here to find the truth!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got. Who was this person that you say Ms. Fey saw in the darkness...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">It looks like you've proven a well-known fact. The fact that people really CAN'T see in the dark!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Urk...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You're just the man I thought you were... You should try a nice, sweet café au lait at least once in your life, Trite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... <thought>B-But I'm sure she saw the killer in the dark...! So the answer is clear! What is visible in the dark!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily. I'm sure the court would like to see for itself how this is possible, yes?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What!? B-But how do you propose to show us something like that!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...It's easy. We just need to recreate the conditions of that night.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">C-Conditions...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! The defense officially requests... ...that all the lights in this courtroom be turned off!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Wh... Wh... This is... ...But it can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Ha...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, everyone...? This is the man Maya saw on the night of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Order! Prosecutor Godot! What is the meaning of this!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Surely you must be shocked to hear yourself accused of such a thing! Why aren't you denying it!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Your Honor. You're asking the wrong person.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What do you mean by that!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you've got a question, ask the witness... That's one of my rules.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Maya!? How about it? What you saw that night... Was it 3 glowing red lights?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, witness? Answer the question.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">... Y... You're wrong! I-I... I never saw that!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M-Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I thought the person that stabbed my mother was a man... ...for a totally different reason!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wha-Whaat?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Witness... M-Mr. Wright, what the...!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Stop your chattering, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ch-Ch-Chattering...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If it's worth asking, ask the witness. That's one of my rules.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...... Alright. Well then, let's continue with the testimony. Please tell us how you knew the killer was a man!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Y-Yes, Your Honor. I didn't realize it until after I woke up, but...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Also, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man. Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So you lost consciousness when you were in the garden. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then the person that carried you into the Inner Temple...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It could only have been the killer...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's what I think, too.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So the killer carried Maya into the Inner Temple...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Naturally the killer must have done it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes, I think so...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...... I... ...... I don't know.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It looks like she doesn't have enough confidence. I think I need to gather some more information before I ask her again...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Naturally the killer must have done it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes, I think so...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You did?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What? Hiding it for you...!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...She may have thought that you had done it...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes. I'm sure of it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, that's certainly an important piece of information! I want you to add that to your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes, Your Honor...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Maya">I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">They did it for your sake...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, I suppose that's true.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. "Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">But still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Maya">The torches were lit... And the body was gone.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The torches were lit?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">The killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? <thought>It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">It looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...But, I think this will help explain them!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">... Nick... I'm sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still one matter that still seems somewhat odd.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Oh? And what would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the message written in blood on the lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. "Maya"...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If the killer was so motivated to protect Maya from suspicion... ...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Aaaaaaah! You're right! Order! Order! Order! B-But, Mr. Wright! Isn't it a fact that the killer was trying to cover up the crime scene...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Indeed. But it doesn't make much sense to move the body and remove the bloody snow... ...then not wipe off the most incriminating thing of all -- the bloody writing!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">But if that's the case... ...do you have an explanation for the killer's mysterious behavior? Why would this killer move the body and remove all that snow... ...but then leave the bloody writing on the lantern...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't know what the killer's plan was... ...but it's a fact that the killer left the writing on the lantern. There must be a reason for it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion. Why did the killer leave the message written in blood on the lantern?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's only one reason... And it's easier to spot than Sister Bikini in a bikini. It's because the killer is the one who wrote it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......</line>
<line speaker="Maya">......</line>
<line speaker="Godot">......</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Too bad, Mr. Wright. Don't you remember the testimony of that rather pathetic, vile woman?</line>
<line speaker="Dahlia">I think... I think I was stabbed. Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... Oh yeah... She did say that, didn't she...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! You and Dahlia... I'm not sure which one of you is more pathetic!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugggghhh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's only one reason! One as obvious as Jean Armstrong in a thong on the Riviera! ...The killer was trying to pin the crime on Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......</line>
<line speaker="Maya">......</line>
<line speaker="Godot">......</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm, Nick. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but... If the killer had meant to put the blame on me... ...then why didn't the killer leave the crime scene as it was?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Once again, you've been pointing that finger where it doesn't belong!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugggghhh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice. "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth."</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Maybe you're not as dumb as I thought.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The real killer wanted to disguise the fact that a crime occurred there. If that's the case... They wouldn't have left the bloody writing on the stone lantern on purpose! Therefore, it must mean that they didn't notice it...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">B-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're right... There is no way any "normal" person would.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What...? What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's only one person involved in this incident... ...who could have missed seeing the bloody writing altogether.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And who would that be!? Who is the person that could have failed to notice the bloody writing!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I think I'll leave some bloody writing when I die, too. I'll write... "Wright Left".</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Is he telling me I need to leave the courtroom...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hey, Trite... You can play after the trial is over!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I'm sure I'm on the right track! I've just got to think more carefully about all that's happened up to this point!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Mr. Godot... This is what you said yesterday...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You can't see everything!? Is that correct, Mr. Godot!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This lantern was submitted as evidence today. I would like the court to think back to the moment it was first presented.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This lantern... There's something written on it! Wh-Why... It's written in blood!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Mr. Godot. Just admit it. There are certain colors you can't see... Correct?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You can't see red on a white background, can you? ...That's right. We went through this once before. During the poisoning case at Trés Bien...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. And somehow spilled coffee on.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You could see the coffee on the white apron... ...But you couldn't see the ketchup. Because it was red.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... Ha...! It's strange... In a black and white photo, those letters would have appeared black to me... I wonder... Why am I the only one that can't see them...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So then... Mr. Godot! Are you admitting it!? Are you admitting that you couldn't see the red writing on the lantern!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Hey, gramps. Didn't you know? That's the reason why I don't drink red tea!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I wasn't sure about it until now, but... I just can't believe it... Prosecutor Godot is the murderer! But... There's no going back now. I've finally figured out the truth...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Mr. Godot. The defense at this time formally accuses you. You are the murderer of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, also known as Ms. Misty Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It's hard to believe this may be true. However... ...once again Mr. Wright has brought up a disquieting fact about you!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Just make sure you don't fill out the indictment in red ink, gramps. Come on... How does a little graffiti make me into the killer?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Besides, it's not like it's my name that's written there.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm certain that the killer wasn't able to see the color red!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This is rich. Do go on, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The answer is right there at the crime scene. In the snow...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The snow? How so?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, for example, why did the killer move all that snow...? Your Honor, you said it yourself. If they wanted to hide the bloody snow, why not take out just that area?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, why didn't they take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes. The killer couldn't see the red blood that had seeped into the snow. And so, he had to remove all of the snow! He couldn't be sure of where the blood had landed, so he removed the whole area!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Isn't it more likely that the killer couldn't see the blood because it was dark?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Not a chance. The torches were all lit. They would have been able to see fine.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......It seems... ...that once again, this trial has taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Can you explain this, Mr. Godot!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">W-Wait! Just wait a minute!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What is it, witness?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">M-Mr. Godot... isn't the killer...! After all, he didn't even come to the Inner Temple... ...until 2 days after the murder took place! He didn't show up until after that old bridge got fixed up!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You can't testify to something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Why...? What do you mean!? I may not look it, but I'm-- Eeeeeeeek!!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">After the murder happened... you didn't even exist.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">She didn't...? I'm afraid I don't follow...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Are you senile, old man? We established this just a little while ago. After the murder, this witness was unconscious for a long time. Because she was channeling Dahlia Hawthorne.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh... That's right...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">P-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">......</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Nicely done, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, let's hear the witness's testimony. Please tell us what happened at the Inner Temple after the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes, sir. After I woke up, I began channeling and my spirit "left me", as it were. But that little girl was there at the Inner Temple, too!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Who is this "Pearly"...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So when did you hear about this?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Whaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Real smart, Maya. You always know the best things to say when you're under oath...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! The prosecution has no objection. We believe the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">M-Mr. Godot!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Let's just move on to the cross-examination... If the defense has no objections...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This is highly unusual, but... Well, Mr. Wright!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... Let's get this cross-examination started.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So where did do you think Pearls slept that night?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">In the spare prep room next to the Training Hall, I guess. There's a rule that you can't enter the Training Hall during an acolyte's training.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But even so, why did she go to the Inner Temple in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It seems that Pearls became very worried about Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">She knew that the spiritual training I was about to undergo was very intense.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Pearls was supposed to channel Dahlia Hawthorne... But she couldn't do it. That's why she headed to the Inner Temple. However, Dahlia Hawthorne was already there... ...possessing the body of Elise Deauxnim.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She searched the entire Inner Temple side, end to end...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The Inner Temple side has two structures: the Training Hall and a spare prep room...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">And there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>There was a storage shack, too?</thought> ...Pearls was looking for other people, right?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Would she have really examined a storage shack all that carefully...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">... Well, if it was me, that would be the first place I would investigate!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So that means it's possible that someone may have been hiding in the storage shack.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Pearls didn't hear the sound of them working on the bridge?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I was just wondering why she would stay in the prep room. If it was me, I'd at least go out and wait at the foot of the bridge.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Oh. Well, Pearly said she was sleeping at the time. She said she was so scared during the night... ...that she couldn't sleep well and woke up a bunch of times.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Poor little girl... All alone like that...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Well, we know that she had at least one friend in the Sacred Cavern. ...Dahlia Hawthorne, who was busy battling with the trick lock...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>She couldn't let anyone see her... So she wouldn't have shown herself to Pearls.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">What happened after the bridge was finally fixed...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony." Those are your words. ...Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Touché, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Hot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Ha! You want to say something, Trite?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It's just like I thought. Godot is lying! If his first visit to the Inner Temple really was after the incident.. He shouldn't know about that piece of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>In any case, I have to find a crack in Godot's armor! While I cross-examine Maya, that is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes! Then Mr. Godot...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Maya">He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-He cheered her up...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's what Pearly said... She said he was a very nice older gentleman. Thank you for looking after my cousin, Mr. Godot!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And here I was thinking you were nothing more than a coffee-addict.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Cut it out... ...You're making me blush.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This guy is really beginning to get on my nerves... In more ways than one...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">The truth is there aren't that many places to look on the Inner Temple side. The policemen were all busy going over the garden with fine-toothed combs. So I decided to carry out an investigation in my own way... Godot-style!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm the same way. I like to hand down verdicts in my own way, Judge-style!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm, maybe I should ask some questions, Phoenix-Style...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">How about it, Mr. Wright? Do you have anything to add?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No. I give up... This whole Phoenix-style thing, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It seems... ...this phrase has become overused, so I'm putting an end to it... Judge-style.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Then let it go already!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So you cheered Pearls up?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">When I found that little girl... ...the first thing she asked about was her cousin, Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Really...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The bridge had burned down and she was huddled up in that tiny shack with no heat... Even though she must have had a truly terrifying night out there... ...she asked about you before she said a thing about herself.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">P-Pearly...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I noticed that you weren't anywhere on the Inner Temple side. But... I couldn't find it in me to tell her that. So I gave her my last cup. With milk and sugar... To hide the bitterness of the harsh truth.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What a sweet story... *sniffle*</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>He had a thermos of coffee? Why doesn't that surprise me?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You said that you conducted an investigation of your own. Did you find anything?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It looks like my investigation went about as well as yours, Trite. After all, I did miss the bloody writing on the lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Well, I didn't miss it, so speak for yourself, Goggles!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">The only odd thing I discovered was the beauty in the Training Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Beauty...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Misty Fey, naturally. Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Western tastes...? Could he find a stranger way to describe gravy...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">So from there you headed for the prep room?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... <thought>Wait a sec... What did Godot say just now? I think I just found his proverbial weak spot!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>There's only one thing of any importance here... Where was Godot when the murder was taking place? He must have already been at the Inner Temple when it happened. Otherwise, he couldn't have killed Elise Deauxnim!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Mr. Godot. The first time you crossed Dusky Bridge and went into the Inner Temple... ...was long before the murder took place.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wh-Why do you say that!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Because he just made one fatal slip-up. The hanging scroll in the Training Hall...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hanging scroll...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">B-But! Mr. Godot is right! That scroll shows a picture of my mother!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya... I know you know who it is, but here's something you didn't know. By the time the bridge had been repaired, two days after the murder... ...the hanging scroll in the Training Hall looked like this.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's that wonderfully delicious smell!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The morning after the crime, someone covered it with gravy.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Gravy...? But why gravy, Nick?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Because gravy was much more than a condiment to the culprit. Well, Mr. Godot!? If you really hadn't seen the hanging scroll until after the murder... ...you wouldn't have had any way of knowing that it was Misty Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">W-Wait a minute, Nick!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">T-Take another look at the hanging scroll! Look! At the top...! There's a crest there!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah, that. It's the mark of the Master, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Exactly! So if you know the meaning of the mark...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Then you could guess that it was a picture of Misty Fey on there!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">True, but Mr. Godot described what was underneath like this. "Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes."</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, it's possible that he knew what the crest meant. ...However! He couldn't have known that she was wearing Japanese clothing! Mr. Godot! On the day of the murder... ...you were hiding at the Inner Temple, long before the crime took place!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Can I ask you just one little thing, Trite?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">This whole theory of yours... It all rests on a certain assumption. That I knew beforehand that a crime was going to be committed.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Th-That's right! Otherwise there's no reason for him to sneak onto the crime scene...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... Of course Mr. Godot knew about the plan.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What did you say!? Is it really possible that another person knew of that plan!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Mr. Wright. At this stage of the game... a mere guess is simply unacceptable.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...So in the end, you were just bluffing, huh? Well, don't expect any sympathy cards from me, Trite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>But there's only one way he could have known about the crime!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Mr. Wright, I'll give you just one more chance.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...This crime was actually planned over a year ago. Morgan Fey authored the plan for her daughter's future... ...and these instructions were hidden somewhere in Fey Manor for a year... However, by the time little Pearls found these instructions... ...they had already been unsealed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Unsealed...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes. The killer had read these instructions long before Pearls ever found them. That's how he knew the crime was to take place at the Inner Temple!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">And you're saying this crafty killer... is me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You bet I am.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But you just said that the instructions were hidden...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Th-That's right! Mr. Godot couldn't have known where the instructions were hidden!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If he really wanted to know, he had one great chance to find out.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes, and when was that...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...During a visit.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">A visit?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Morgan Fey told her daughter, Pearl, about where the instructions were hidden... ...during one of her visits to the detention center. That would be the only time for someone to have learned where they were hidden.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ea-Eavesdropping on a visit at the detention center!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, it could be arranged if you were someone with easy access in and out of there. Like for example, a prosecutor such as Mr. Godot!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Order! M-Mr. Godot...! You're under fire again!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...This murder could not have been carried out without prior knowledge! And you...! You were the only one that could've acquired this information before the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Humans are afraid of the dark. And yet... At the same time, we're fascinated and bewitched by it. Maybe that's why humans drink the darkness that is coffee.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Umm... Sorry for always asking, but what does that mean?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It means there's a reason for everything. According to your theory, the killer in this case eavesdropped... ...on a conversation during a jail visit where he learned of a hidden plan for a crime.  After discovering the plans, he hid in the Inner Temple and waited for the crime to occur. Then he ultimately took a person's life. ...And he did all of that just to protect this witness?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you're accusing me of this crime, I have to ask you... Why would I do this? This girl is nothing but a stranger to me. I've got no reason to go through that kind of trouble to protect her. I am what you see. I am certainly not the type to rescue the damsel in distress.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... The killer's behavior is... certainly... extreme... for lack of a better word. Even considering that the killer wanted to protect this witness's life... ...his behavior is still a little too unnatural!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">However... ...you had a good reason didn't you, Mr. Godot? An unshakable reason that forced you to protect this witness at all costs!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...... I knew it... You've figured it out, haven't you, Nick...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya... I guess you were doing your best to cover for Godot... ...for the same reason, huh?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">OK, Trite. I'm all ears. ...Let's hear it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's very simple... Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What's this...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's one person who lies at the very center of this whole story. One person that ties you and Maya Fey together inextricably!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Sorry, but at this point in my life, I'm a lone wolf. I've got no connection to that person whatsoever.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, and by the way, I don't have any connection with them either, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What am I doing...? If I think about Godot's true identity, the answer is obvious!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">How's it going, Trite? I knew it... Has this whole trial just been too much for you...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure... But I am sure about one thing!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you! After all... She is Mia Fey's only sister.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Mia... Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You once worked alongside her. That was when you... were a defense attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Wait a second here! Mr. Godot is... is a defense attorney!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">With Your Honor's piercing intellect, you must have figured it out by now... The real name of this man who calls himself "Godot"... His real name is... Diego Armando. Isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The last time someone called me by that name... ...was over 6 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Diego Armando... That name rings a bell...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It should, Your Honor. All of this is related to a single case... A case in which a convict named Terry Fawles killed himself... Mia Fey's first time in court. The tragic outcome left a deep wound in her heart. She knew that behind it all was a heartless, scheming demoness in disguise. But in the end, Mia couldn't tear off that disguise. However, there was one man who reached out to help her. ...Diego Armando, a senior defense lawyer at the office where Mia worked.</line>
<line speaker="Mia">It's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!</line>
<line speaker="Armando">............... Mia... You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">... I was moved by her... The way she put all her faith in her clients... That pure, sweet heart of hers... That's why... I could never forgive Dahlia Hawthorne. Mia and I thoroughly investigated that fake kidnapping incident. Then one fateful day, Dahlia wanted to meet with me... It had been 6 months since the trial... We met in the courthouse cafeteria.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah...! I just remembered! 6 years ago! Right here in this courthouse! You were poisoned...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Even I didn't see it coming. Dahlia Hawthorne slipped some poison into my coffee.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Some newspapers at the time called it a murder. But very little information about the case was released to the press...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But you weren't dead at all!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">No official reports ever actually called it a murder. I was just in a deep, deep coma...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...My body shut down, and my life became nothing but a long, deep sleep. That woman's poison did a real number on my central nervous system... I lost my sight, and all of my hair turned white due to the damage it caused.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's terrible...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Apparently it was a miracle that I ever regained consciousness. Five years had passed since I drank that poisoned brew... Then one morning, my eyes flew open... from the smell of a doctor's cup of coffee.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">F-Five years...!? You were asleep for 5 years!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">And the worst possible news was waiting for me... ...Mia Fey was dead. From the very moment I opened my eyes... I had already lost everything I thought I had. The woman I loved had been murdered... And the woman I loathed had been sentenced to death.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The woman you loathed...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The woman who had spiked my scalding hot coffee... Dahlia Hawthorne! Ha...! Good ol' Mia. She didn't let me down. She got her revenge before she checked out. In the end... There wasn't anyone waiting for me when I woke up.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Th-That's so sad...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">For someone like me... For someone who had slept away their best days... ...there were only 2 reasons left to live. And it was for those 2 reasons that I decided to become a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If I may ask... What were your 2 reasons to live...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The first was you, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...!? M... M-Me?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If I hadn't drank that stupid poison... ...Mia Fey never would have died, much less the way she did.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You were the only one who was there to protect her! But you let her die. It was all your fault.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I... It wasn't like that...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I wanted to see for myself what kind of a man you really were.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So that's why you became a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">My other reason for living... She goes by the name of Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh? You mean me...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You were the only way I could make up for the sin of not saving Mia. One year ago, when the Kurain Village incident was resolved... ...it was obvious that Morgan Fey was planning something. Whatever her evil plan was, I was determined to stop it. My role as a prosecutor put me in the perfect position to do something about her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's how you overheard Pearls's visit with Morgan at the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I knew that the time was drawing near. Since I knew the plan, I thought I could foil it. My goal was to outwit the plan. I thought if I could do that... ...I could keep that girl from being caught up in it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That makes sense... If Pearls had known that the actual purpose of the plan was to kill Maya... ...she never would have helped out.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Finally, the day of the plan was drawing near... I contacted both of my accomplices.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Accomplices...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Iris of Hazakura Temple and... Misty Fey. I especially needed the help of Iris... She was to take the fall in my back-up plan in case we couldn't control Pearl Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">B-But...! How did you contact my mother!? She had been missing for almost 20 years!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Officially, yes...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">What!? What do you mean, officially!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You've heard about it, haven't you? About the strong ties between the main family and the government...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Now that you mention it... Bikini did say something to that effect... She said that the Master of Kurain had great authority...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Even without her official position, Misty Fey still wielded great influence... The police have been keeping an eye on her movements all this time. That's how I was able to contact her... Again, because of my position as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">So my mother... was cooperating with you?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Don't ever forget... ...no matter how far away from you she was, she never stopped thinking about you.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sh-She was always...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That's why... I knew she would do anything to protect you. If you want to know how strong her resolve to protect you was, look at her staff.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Her staff...? The one with the sword in it?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">The day the plan was to be carried out arrived soon enough... We met for the first time at Hazakura Temple. That's when your mother showed me her special staff... I realized it then... Just how far she was willing to go... She was ready to use that sword to protect you from Morgan Fey, if necessary. ...Yes! Even if it meant paying the ultimate price.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">M-Mother...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That night... The night of the crime. There was just one way to stop Morgan's evil plan.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You mean Pearls, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">We had to make sure she didn't channel Dahlia Hawthorne...</line>
<line speaker="Elise">...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Well, umm...</line>
<line speaker="Elise">If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">We thought we could prevent her from playing her part in Morgan's plan. But... She never showed up.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">She was worried and followed me to the Inner Temple...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">That was the thing we were most afraid of. And that's why... Misty Fey had to do the channeling herself. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne into her own body.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What...!? What do you mean!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If she channeled the spirit first... ...then Pearls wouldn't be able to do it herself.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">As Master of Kurain, Misty Fey's power was supreme. So that's how it went down. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne so that Pearl Fey wouldn't be able to!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah...! Whaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What...!? Is this true!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">My role in the plan was to make sure no one was going to hurt Maya Fey. That's why... I hid myself at the Inner Temple. Just in case you needed to be saved from Dahlia Hawthorne.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Godot...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Anyway... That's all I'm going to admit to... Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">There's no doubt about it. You're a great defense lawyer. But... you're going to have to do the rest yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The background leading up to this incident has been laid bare. There's just one question remaining, Mr. Wright. "Who killed the victim?" There are only two possible suspects right now. Maya Fey... And I'm sad to say... you, Mr. Godot!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Well, Trite... If you're the real deal... ...then finish this thing once and for all. Show us beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can finish this on your own!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N-No, Nick...! P-Please don't!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M... Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I... I heard the whole thing. From my sister... In the medical office...! That's why! That's why... I have to protect Mr. Godot...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I can't do it... I can't testify against him... After all... ...he's the man who put his life on the line to protect Mia... and me, too!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya... I know that!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N-Nick...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But even so... It doesn't absolve him of his crime! ...Please, Maya. Testify.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ms. Fey. Your testimony please.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is the final testimony. Don't bother trying to hide anything, because I'll know. I want to hear the truth from your own lips...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...... I understand. I'm sure you're right... I'm ready now, Nick...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright, young lady... Tell us about the moments before you lost consciousness. What exactly happened at the time of the murder!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">These red lights... I thought you said you don't remember seeing them!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I-I'm sorry... I thought I saw them, but then they disappeared all of a sudden...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! Things break, Trite... Even the best of theories.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Who was it that stabbed Misty Fey? It looks like you still can't prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya is telling the truth this time, I know it... The rest is up to me!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well then, Mr. Wright! Proceed with your final cross-examination of the witness!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Lights shining in the dark? I don't think you could make a mistake about that.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Yeah, you're right. I think I saw them, but... I can't say for certain... And I can't tell you for sure they were from Mr. Godot's mask either...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't get the feeling she's covering for him anymore, but...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But just after that, you turned towards the lights and called for help. Isn't that because you thought the lights were coming from Mr. Godot's mask?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yeah... I guess so. Maybe that's what I was thinking at the time... But... I can't remember. After all... ...there was a person I couldn't identify in front of me!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya's life was in terrible danger at the time. There's no way she can remember the details of the scene perfectly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Alright then, let's go on with the testimony. What did you do when you saw the red lights?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That blood... Was it Dahlia Hawthorne's blood...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I think so, probably. Just at that moment... ...I heard a soft scream that seemed to be close by. It was a woman's voice.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So that was when the killer stabbed the victim from behind with the murder weapon... Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Without a doubt, Maya was in the middle of a really dangerous situation...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Anyway... the victim was stabbed by the murder weapon. What happened after that?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">She wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-Struck back...!? How do you know that?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, you're right... I didn't see it exactly... But I could tell by the sounds of their breathing and movement. And also, the smell of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You have witnessed more horror than any young lady should ever have to in one life. So then, what did you do at that point?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I... I couldn't move. I could just barely make out their shadows moving in the dark, but... I had no idea what to do!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Could you still see the red lights you mentioned earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-Yes. I-I think so. But...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Suddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">They went out?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-Yes. Suddenly I couldn't see them at all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What could it mean?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>If the red lights were coming from Godot's mask... And they went out right in the middle of a fight...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">Maybe the mask was damaged.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Or maybe it was knocked off.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Or maybe... the batteries ran out. Right, Trite?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Or maybe those little red pin-head looking lights just stopped working.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What could have really happened then!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you mean by, "Just at that moment"? Do you mean the moment when the red lights went out?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Yes, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The scream that you heard then, was it Dahlia Hawthorne?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">... I don't think so. I'm pretty sure... ...it was a man's voice.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wha-Wha-Wha... Whaaaaaaaat!? S-So then, that scream came... from the killer!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's got to be it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Hmmm... Hmmmm...!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I think... ...Dahlia Hawthorne must have taken the blade and attacked the killer with it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And then the killer let out a scream of pain, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">After that, the killer stole the blade back and delivered the final blow... I guess.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well, Mr. Wright? It seems to make sense to me...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It sounds like a reasonable deduction, but I still kinda wonder...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think that's exactly how it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Of course. After all, my deductions are almost certainly always correct. Alright, let's go on with the testimony. The killer and the victim were fighting ferociously... What happened then?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm sorry to say this... ...but that interpretation would create an enormous contradiction!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That makes sense. After all, my deductions are almost certainly never correct.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Remember the testimony she just gave. Before the killer let out a scream... ...Maya said she had already been splattered by the victim's blood.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">In other words, the blade in the staff had already been plunged into the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah...! Is-Is that right...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She couldn't have struck back with a sword that was already stuck in her body. The weapon that caused the killer to let out a scream... ...must have been something other than the staff!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If you're so sure about that, then don't keep us waiting any longer, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>There's only one thing I can think of... ...that could have been used as the weapon here!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">If Dahlia Hawthorne had already been stabbed in the back by the staff... ...what could she have used to strike back at the killer?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Your Honor? What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">To be honest with you... I feel like using my gavel to strike back at you right now.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You're nothing but a joke. I knew you couldn't take it all the way.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uggggh...! <thought>How could I mess up at a time like this...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright, let's go on with the testimony. The killer and the victim were fighting ferociously... What happened then?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Right after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And what about the killer that stabbed Dahlia...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...I'm sorry, I don't know. ... R-Really! It's true, Nick!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe you... <thought>On this point, I'm sure Maya isn't lying.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! It appears... ...that the darkness has proven to be your undoing, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I've got to use this testimony to prove that Godot committed the murder! I really wish I didn't have to do it... But for some reason... I get the feeling that some part of Godot actually wants me to...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Naturally, the dagger the killer brought to the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh...! That's right! I forgot about that...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This dagger was found at the crime scene, stuck into a pine tree.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Yes, the detective found that this morning and brought it to me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Dahlia Hawthorne struck back at the killer with this! And she managed to wound him as well!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Just because he let out a scream doesn't mean that he was wounded. For all we know, the blood on the dagger could have been from the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Have you forgotten that the blood has already been tested?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Since we learned it wasn't the victim's blood, it must be the killer's blood! The killer must have a wound somewhere on his body!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So you're saying the blood on this dagger belongs to the killer...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly! A DNA analysis of the blood would prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt! And yes, Mr. Godot. It would prove that it's your blood!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Nice theory, Trite.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Is this the end...? Have I done it...? Even he won't be able to change the results of a scientific test!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Ha! Let me ask you something, Trite. Let's just say that it turned out that I was the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Do you really think I would be stupid enough to leave evidence like that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Just think for a second. This dagger was found this morning by a detective and brought to me. There was already a bloodstain on it, correct? But even so... I was the one who brought this dagger here to the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes... What does that prove?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Well, if I really were the killer... ...I could've washed the blade off and then planted another person's blood on it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's... It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">In any case, there's one thing I can guarantee, Trite. That blood... It doesn't belong to me. Not a chance!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Whaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In any event, it seems to be established that the killer was wounded. Alright then, witness. Continue your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">W-Wait a minute...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...What's the problem?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Umm, I... I know I probably shouldn't say this, but... ...there's a big contradiction in Nick's explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M-Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Th-This dagger... You said that it wounded the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">But... But, but...! If Mr. Godot had really been cut with the dagger... ...his clothes should be bloody or have a rip in them, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Umm, Maya? Maybe he just changed his clothes? That'd solve the contradiction pretty easily.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">What are you talking about? It's not that simple at all! Remember back to the day of the murder! Everyone that was on the Inner Temple side got trapped there!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah! Th-That's right! And once the bridge was fixed and the police headed for the Inner Temple...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Mr. Godot was already there waiting for them! He never had a chance to change his clothes!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaack!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! What the witness says is true--</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-Well, maybe he brought a change of clothes with him!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But... No one could have predicted the lightning strike that shut down the bridge! Why would anyone have brought a change of clothes!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nngh...! <thought>Did the judge take smart pills during the last recess?</thought> Well then! Maybe the killer took off his clothes before he committed the murder! That way he wouldn't get any blood on them!</line>
<line speaker="Godot"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Godot">That's impossible, Trite. You know how cold it gets up there late at night!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Eh...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">After a few minutes with no clothes on, you'd be frozen solid!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Hmmm... Hmmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! So that's all you've got... I knew you weren't tough enough to finish this.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Urk...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Right now... if Mia Fey were here...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">If Mia Fey were here... She would have closed the book on this case already.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>If Mia Fey were here...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">So come on, Trite! Can you do it or not!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How about it, Mr. Wright? You've accused Mr. Godot of being the killer. But can you prove it? Have you got even one piece of evidence!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">... <thought>The question isn't whether I can prove it or not... The fact is, I have to prove it! That's the only choice I have. I was taught that it's one of the rules of being a lawyer!</thought> ...I can prove it. I'm going to bring your magnificent vengeance to fruition, just as you want it.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! That's good... A fighter till the bitter end, Trite...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Since there's just one piece of evidence that can prove your point... ...why don't we go for the unlimited penalty?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you trying to pressure me, Mr. Godot? Because it doesn't matter to me. I've got the one piece of evidence I need.</line>
<line speaker="Godot">G-Give me a break! You've got nothing, Trite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So what do I do at a time like this...? It's simple! I've gotta think outside the box and approach this from a different angle!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've got.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...There's one thing I've demonstrated in the previous cross-examination. The killer was wounded. That was proven by the blood on the dagger.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But... We decided it was impossible for him to have hidden such a wound! If he had been cut by a dagger, there should have been a bloodstain on his clothing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's one place... One place the killer could have hidden his wound.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">H-hidden...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This is it! My last stand! I need to think about this from a different angle! I don't need to think about why there were no bloodstains on his clothing... I need to show how he hid the wound!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot">It's the end of the line! The final stop, Trite! Let's hear what you've got! Where's this location where you say the killer hid his wound!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! I don't know what you're talking about... And frankly, I don't need to know. What I do know is that you'll never be half the lawyer she was! Isn't that right, Trite...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it looks like you've proven one thing. That you're nothing but a fake!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-Wait a minute! Give me one more chance!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I don't think so! A promise is a promise!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Ha...! It was fun while it lasted. See you later... Trite...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...Ha! I don't know what you're talking about... And frankly, I don't need to know. What I do know is that you'll never be half the lawyer she was! Isn't that right, Trite...? ...! <thought>Wh-What was that just now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Godot"><thought>It-It can't be! You're living on... through him...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Even as we speak, you're still hiding the wound! It's beneath your mask! During the fight, the red lights given off by the killer suddenly disappeared. Seconds later, the killer let out a scream. That's right. Your mask went flying off your face! Mr. Godot! Would you mind removing your mask? If you have a dagger wound under there somewhere... ...then I'd say this whole case is solved!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Just now... I saw her spirit in you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">...... I never liked you. Six years ago... ...you helped the woman who put me to sleep by hiding her bottle of poison. And then... While I was sleeping... ...you let Mia die. But you didn't care. You just kept living your pathetic, happy-go-lucky life. You even had the nerve to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer. I could never forgive you. That's what I thought.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Mr. Godot...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But... I was wrong about you. I knew it from the very beginning. The truth is, the only person I could never find it in my heart to forgive... ...was me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-You, yourself...?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I was the one that failed to protect Mia... ...Me and no one else. I tried to avert my eyes from the truth... to escape from the harshness of reality. I just couldn't face Mia's death head on, so I ran! I hid behind a mask. I threw away my true name. I couldn't even deal with being a defense attorney anymore, so I quit.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But, but! You saved Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Yeah. That was my plan... Up until just now, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wh-What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Are you listening, Maya? If I had really wanted to save you... ...then there's one person that I should have gone and talked to right away.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wh-Who would that be...? Are you talking about Nick?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">But I didn't do it... I tried to get the help of Iris and your mother... But I closed my eyes to the most important man involved. Do you know why? The real reason?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">No... Why?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I suppose... I wasn't really interested in saving you at all.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh...!?</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I think I was just trying to salvage what's left of my own broken soul... I was trying to make up for the fact that I couldn't save Mia. Nothing more. That's why I let you walk right into a situation that I knew was dangerous. Forgive me...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You're wrong! You put your life on the line to save Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">Was it really for Maya's sake...? Even I'm not really sure.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What do you mean </line>
<line speaker="Godot">That night, in the darkness of the garden, when I saw her silhouette... A part of me must have known the truth... The truth that it wasn't really Dahlia Hawthorne standing there in front of me.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Godot">It could have been Misty Fey... Or even that little girl. But I still picked up the blade... It was like I was dreaming! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in my mind at that point... Was I really motivated by the pure desire to protect Maya Fey? Or was it something else...? Was it my hatred for a woman who had stolen everything from me 6 years earlier...? Could it have been simply a desire for revenge? And now, I don't know anything anymore! I did learn something today, however. I finally realized that I was the arrogant one. I was just... chasing an illusion, a fantasy. The stupid fantasy of defeating you in the courtroom...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">You were the one who made me realize my folly. You never ran away from Mia's death. Instead, you picked up where she left off, as a true defender of the people. In that one moment... I understood everything!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Mr. Godot...</line>
<line speaker="Godot">I think you already know this, but if you don't... My name is... Diego Armando.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">M-Mr. Armando! I believe in you! I know you were trying to save me!</line>
<line speaker="Armando">Hmm... Thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Your wound...! It's bleeding!</line>
<line speaker="Armando">...Ha! Did you forget already? In my world, the color red doesn't exist.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Armando">These must be... my tears.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Tears...?</line>
<line speaker="Armando">Ever since I woke up from my coma... ...I think I've been waiting for this very moment.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">M-Mr. Armando...</line>
<line speaker="Armando">You'd do well to remember this, Maya. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This time... It really is all over, isn't it. ...Defendant.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Although you weren't directly involved in the murder... ...tampering with the body and the crime scene is a serious offense in itself.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I understand, Your Honor. Mr. Armando explained that to me very carefully... I knew the risk and I willingly cooperated anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well. Before I hand down my verdict, is there anything you'd like to say?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...... Well, there is one thing. I'd like to say something to Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I want to... I want to apologize to you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apologize? To me? For what?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">For the case 6 years ago, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I just remembered... Weren't you poisoned by your own lover?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Not exactly, but yeah, something like that. Even now... 6 years later, I can hardly believe it. She was going to do it... She was planning to kill me...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...... It's not all that surprising. The two of you... You hardly knew each other.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You and my sister... You only met twice.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... Huh. W-We only met t-twice?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The first time you met was on that fateful day... The day she poisoned Mr. Armando in the cafeteria of this very courthouse. The next time you met her was... six months later. You met her again on the day that she stole your cold medicine... ...and Doug Swallow was killed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">N-N-No way! It just... It can't be true! I mean, during our whole relationship, we were...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...... For those 6 months... ...the woman that you thought was Dahlia Hawthorne... ...wasn't actually my sister.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Huh? It wasn't Dahlia...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">... I hope one day you can forgive me... Feenie.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You... Y-Y-You mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right... I lied to you... for 6 months.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But why...!? Why would you do such a thing?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ever since she gave you the bottle that day... ...my sister was trying to get it back as soon as she possibly could. Because of the police investigation and their surveillance... ...she couldn't move about freely.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So that's why you...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">My sister... From the beginning, she was prepared for the worst.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">P-Prepared for the worst?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">She thought that you might somehow discover the truth. That's why she was always ready to deal with you at a moment's notice...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>You mean she was ready to kill me, don't you...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">She already had so much to answer for, I didn't want any more sins on her soul. I begged her not to do it, and she agreed to give me a chance.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And that's why... you came to me? You came to get the bottle pendant back from me in her place?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But I couldn't get you to give it back... I failed at something even as simple as that. Six months passed and I still couldn't get it back from you. Finally, my sister couldn't wait any longer. She didn't consult me about her plans for you that day. ...It was the first time that had ever happened.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That was a bit strange, wasn't it? Up until that day, you two were partners in crime, and she would confer with you...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I think... she must have noticed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...? Noticed what?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">My feelings for you. If I had found out she was planning to kill you... ...I would have done whatever was necessary to stop her. Even if it meant her life... or mine.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-Iris...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">After spending half a year by your side... ...my feelings towards you... They changed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... I have something to say to you, too.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You really are the person I always thought you were. Even after Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... I still believed in you.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...... Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Armando">How many cups of darkness have I drank over the years? Even I don't know... I'll tell you though... Right now, this one here is the greatest cup I think I've ever had. Don't you think so... Phoenix Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah... I think you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The purpose of this trial was to rule on the murder of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. At some point, I expect you will be tried for your role as an accomplice in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I understand, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well! On the charge of murder, I hereby find the defendant...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Court is now adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>So I guess it's all over... The way everything ended... Was justice really served...? The man who risked his life to save Maya is being sent to prison by my own hand...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mia">Of course justice was served.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M-Mia!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">...I'm proud of you, Phoenix. Your defense was... truly brilliant.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">B-But I couldn't save Mr. Armando! The man who cared so deeply for you...</line>
<line speaker="Mia">You're wrong, Phoenix. You did save Diego. You saved him in the only way possible.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You mean... with that verdict...?</line>
<line speaker="Mia">... I think one day, you'll understand, too. Phoenix, I want you to remember one thing... You were as good out there today as any defense lawyer could ever hope to be. There's nothing more you can learn from me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M-Mia...!</line>
<line speaker="Mia">You've accomplished something I wasn't able to. I owe you a great deal. ...Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Mia...</line>
<line speaker="Mia">I'm sure we'll meet again... someday... Phoenix.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I've handled lots of cases and seen a lot of things... And along this journey, I've found myself asking just one question... What does it really mean to defend someone? ...I suppose today's case produced one possible answer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Nick...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M-Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I guess it's just like my sis said...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your sister...? Mia...?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That night, when I channeled Mia to get her advice on what to do... This is what she wrote back in my notebook. "Don't worry. Phoenix will save everyone in the end."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">B-But...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Come on! Cut it out with that gloomy face! Can't you see? Me, sis, and I'm sure Iris, too... We owe you for everything you have done for us, Nick!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Maya... How? How can you be so bright and chipper after all that's happened...? You were brutally attacked... You even saw your mother murdered...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeeeowch! F-Franziska!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excellent work, Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh!? Mr. Edgeworth!? When did you get back?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Oh, that's right... I guess no one filled her in on that.</thought> Edgeworth and Franziska have actually been helping me.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Helping you...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If these two hadn't been here on the first day of the trial... ...the defense wouldn't have gotten anywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wow... But where were you, Nick?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, he laid in bed shivering from his fever with Iris's hood pulled over his head.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh, ouch! Talk about embarrassing, Nick. You definitely need more training! Anyway, thank you, Mr. Edgeworth! And you too... um... Franziska!</line>
<line speaker="???">I don't suppose...</line>
<line speaker="Butz">...there's room for me in this group hug, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh! Larry!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What's with the, uh... longer than usual face?</line>
<line speaker="Butz">I realized something when I was reborn... ...I realized that Larry was never of any use to anyone. Not even once.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What? You're asking me!?</line>
<line speaker="Butz">Well, Nick!? Is it true!? I've got a place in this world, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Oh, um... Y-Yeah, of course. ............</line>
<line speaker="Butz">I knew it. Everyone would be better off if I were gone for good.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no, no! Umm, I... Oh yeah! Those portraits you painted! They were... really good. Isn't that right, Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? M-Me?</line>
<line speaker="Butz">Why are you making that face!? Huh, Edgey!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh, well, um, yes, indeed... I certainly can't say that it's lacking resemblance.</line>
<line speaker="Butz">Do you really mean it!? What about you, Franzy? Did I draw you well, too!? Waaah!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...*glare*</line>
<line speaker="Butz">So then you'll do it!? Like you promised!? You're going to model for my next picture book, "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash"? Aaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Butz">Well, how about that! I guess painting portraits is the only thing I'm good at. The painting of Pearl was pretty darn good too, if you ask me! Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that you mention it... I haven't seen her around.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Pearls... <thought>Where could she have gone? Normally she would have made a beeline for Maya...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh... I'll go look for her! Be right back!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Wright. You seem to be uncharacteristically puzzled. I suspect you are wondering how Maya can be so cheerful despite all that has happened?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yeah...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Franziska... That's right... She lost her father fairly recently as well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think I understand how she feels. Maya is a much wiser person than she appears, and I think she realizes something... Now is exactly the time when she needs to be as strong as she can.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Maya wasn't the only one that was badly wounded by this incident. In fact, there was someone that was hurt far more deeply than she. I believe it's for that person that Maya is trying her best not to cry.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Someone who was hurt more deeply than Maya...</thought> Edgeworth... I think I'm starting to understand, too.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Owwwww!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The poor kid. After all, the reason that she worked so hard to follow the instructions... ...was because she loved and believed in her mother, Morgan. "It's for the good of the Fey clan"... I'm sure she believed in every last word. She thought she was doing it for Maya... That's why she was so happy. It shows how truly devoted she is to Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But it's a cruel irony that it was her exuberance that led to this tragedy. Maya Fey's mother was killed and Maya herself was put into the deepest peril imaginable.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>And that's exactly why Maya is putting on a brave face... She's doing it for Pearls's sake... Until she can see her smile again...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Well, don't worry, Wright... I'm not certain that my guess is entirely correct either. Only Maya can really say what the truth is inside her heart.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It looks like... I still have a lot to learn about Maya.</thought> Aaaaaargh!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh, hey! So this is where you all were! Wow, looks like we've got quite the bunch here toda-- YEOWCH! Wh-What was that for, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What's up, Detective Gumshoe?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh, you know. This and that. Anyway, congrats on your win! Let's go out tonight, pal! Dinner's on me! My salary's just sorta kinda gone down by a teeny-weeny bit, but it's alright! I made reservations at a first class French restaurant tonight! AAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Umm... Detective Gumshoe. You said a first class French restaurant... You don't mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Trés Bien, where else!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I knew it... We're doomed.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Come on! Let's go, everyone! Can't keep Maggey waiting, pal! Hey! You! Crybaby! You're invited, too!</line>
<line speaker="Butz">Oh... Forget about me. Pearl and I will be at the losers' shack eating potatoes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>You know... Maya is taking an awfully long time to get back... She's still out looking for Pearls...</thought> Oh... Maya... What's wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Nick... What do I do...? Pearly... I can't find her anywhere!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'll bet she just went back home. Th-That's all!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I thought so too, so I called the village... But no one has heard from her! This has never happened before!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I figured... She has been badly hurt by this incident. She feels responsible for the tragedy that has befallen you, Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">B-But... None of this was her fault! What... What should I do...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, what is it, pal?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Could you guys go on ahead?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But... But what about you!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya and I will... We'll join you guys once we find Pearls.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Nick...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't worry about us, Detective Gumshoe. We may be a little late... But we'll definitely be there. We have a lot of celebrating to do tonight, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-Yeah, but you're the... AAAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't keep us waiting, Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We won't...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">B-But where should we look!? Where could Pearly have gone...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's go, Maya. There's only one place I can think of that Pearls might have gone to...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hazakura Temple...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">For Pearls, I bet this is a very important place. After all, it's where this whole incident started.</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">What's this? You're all back again so soon?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sister Bikini?</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">I thought we'd be eating mashed potatoes alone tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">S-So she's here? Pearly is here...?</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">She's in the Training Hall. Why don't you hurry along and go see her?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">O-OK!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Pearly's not here...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah...! Maya! The hanging scroll!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah! Someone cleaned it off...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It's got to be Pearls...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Aaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">P-Pearly...! Why... Why did you just leave like that?</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Mystic Maya... Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">I swore... I swore that I would never trouble the two of you ever again. Because... It's all my fault that... Mystic Maya's mother...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's why you came here?</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">It's the least I could do... To pray for your happiness!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">You don't have to do that, Pearly. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Of course I'm sad that my mother is gone... But... how do I say this? I... I'm still happy.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Y-You don't have to lie just to make me feel better!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">No, really... It's true... The only reason I'm still here at all is thanks to everyone who was there for me.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">...!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">My sis, my mother, Mr. Armando, Nick... And... you. If even one of you weren't there, I'm sure I wouldn't still be alive right now. That's why... I have to be strong. For all the people that were there for me when I needed them. That's all I can really do.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">M-Mystic Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">I'm impressed... You truly are the daughter of Mystic Misty.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sister Bikini...!</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">Your mother, Mystic Misty, was a strong woman indeed. I want to tell you what she said to me that night.</line>
<line speaker="Misty">After dishonoring the good name of Kurain, I don't have the right to face my daughter. But still... Maya is always in my thoughts. It's true... She'll always be with me, until the day I die...</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">Your spirit was with her... That's why your mother was so strong. Even at the end... I'm sure she had no regrets.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">......</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"She'll always be with me, until the day I die", huh...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's a rule or something all Masters are to follow, isn't there? To never take the charm off until the day you die...</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Th-That's the Master's Talisman...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The thing that Misty kept by her heart and would never take off... It wasn't the container that was important. Rather, it was the contents.</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">Th-That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">A photo?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah...! M... ...Mother...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others. But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That's the true measure of what human life is worth. We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question. Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed... We always return... Time and time again. Mia, Maya, Pearls, Mr. Armando... ...and Maya's mother, too... I learned that... from all of them.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well... Shall we get going? Everyone is waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is a day to remember. A day when a lot of things were finally put to rest. I think we should celebrate what we've overcome today.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">B-But... I-I still can't...</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">...Oh, go on, sweetie. You can come back for training anytime.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Um... OK!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Alright! I'm going to make a brand new start, too! Sister Bikini! I'll be back for more training! I promise!</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">I know, and I won't go easy on you just because you're the future Master. I'll make sure to prepare reservations for three for when you come back! Wa ha ha ho ho ho hee hee hee!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Alright! We're going to have a great feast today, Pearly. You know why? Because training is a battle of endurance!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">OK, Mystic Maya! I... I'll eat lots and lots of food tonight!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Um, you know. There's one thing I don't get... and probably don't want to, but...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">What is it, Nick?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Reservations for training is fine and all... But why for three?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Come on! What do you think? You're one of us, Nick! Next time you can train right alongside us!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">I'll be waiting for you. Sister Bikini will take special care of you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">It'll be great, Nick! We're going to do the Special Course, naturally!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">That's a great idea! After all, Mr. Nick... ...you'd do anything for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you? Even walk on hot coals, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">We'll have a nice, big meal before we come next time! Right, Nick!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...... ...You know... I was wondering if I can say just one little thing...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sure! Of course you can!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Oh, I love this part! I can't wait to hear it...!</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">I'm getting goosebumps, too!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well then... Here goes nothing...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Maya">I'll really have to work extra hard now! Master of Kurain and the office manager of Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices. And I have to be a good big sister to Pearly and Nick, too! Well, as long as I'm not locked up or captured or something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">So it's true! Mr. Nick really is Mystic Maya's knight in shining armor! He went through with the Special Course, all the way to the end! Actually, I heard there's a legendary, extra-special Ultra Course here, too. I think I'll surprise the two of them by making them a secret reservation...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Maggey bought me a brand new coat as a present, pal! I feel 10 years younger! I'll never take it off!</line>
<line speaker="Byrde">Yes, but somehow you just don't seem the same! I guess a dirty, shabby old overcoat is just more detective-like, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Don't worry about it! In the name of love, a man will soil himself silly!</line>
<line speaker="Andrews">Mr. Wright, I am once again in your debt. Thanks to you, the Treasures of Kurain exhibit was a great success! I even got to see Ms. von Karma, who I hadn't seen for almost a year. She taught me how to use a whip, and said that I must show you what I've learned...</line>
<line speaker="Ron">Dessie and I started a company called, "Mask☆DeMasque Consulting".</line>
<line speaker="Desirée">We're dedicated to stopping the evil plans of all the criminals in the city!</line>
<line speaker="Ron">Our motto is, "Cut it out, pleeeeeeeease!"</line>
<line speaker="Desirée">Pretty cute, huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Ron">Well, we also sell plans to the criminals as a kind of side-business... ...I wonder if that's OK. Sometimes I think maybe we're the worst criminals.</line>
<line speaker="Viola">Mr. Wright... I want to thank you for... exterminating... Don Tigre... I returned the $500,000... along with a tea set. A special thick tea... One I mixed with... my own two hands... I bet he's drinking it now... Win Through Compromise... Hee... Hee... Hee...</line>
<line speaker="Kudo">I'm just old and in the way! A wrinkly, grumpy, clown-nosed waste of flesh! At least, that's what I thought... But my grandkids had a birthday party for me the other day. Talk about embarrassing. 69 years old and I cried like a baby with a dirty diaper!</line>
<line speaker="Basil">As usual, we have an abundance of work to do. We've hired a new programmer to replace Glen Elg. I do hope everyone will get along. His name is... Adam Mada. As soon as I heard his name, I knew our brain circuits would align perfectly.</line>
<line speaker="Bikini">My, my, my. More reporters? Since the murder, we've made so much money, I hardly know what to do! I think the magazines like us because I provide such a nice visual. Especially in Spring. I can hardly wait for Iris to come back. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...You've turned into such a respectable man, Feenie. It was so sweet of you and everyone else to come and visit me here the other day. Of course I was happy that you constantly had your eyes on me, but... ...I felt kind of bad when the little one slapped you so hard you got a nose bleed.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">What's this!? I'm back from a long and tiring vacation and no one is here to greet me!? I guess while I was gone, my little whippersnapper buddy quit and now I've got no one! And what kind of lonely, crazy security room is this supposed to be anyway!? What with all the flashing lights and switches, I feel like some sort of space alien! And now what am I going to do with all these macadamia nuts I brought back for everyone!? If I bring them over to Edgey-poo, I know exactly what he'd say the instant he saw them. "I really can't accept these, I'm afraid," or something just as painful to this fragile heart. Oh, when will I ever find a gentleman who will treat me like a refined lady?</line>
<line speaker="Ray Gun">*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*</line>
<line speaker="Butz">I finally found something I love to do! "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash" is gonna turn the art world on its head! I should have realized it sooner. Self-centered, lazy, anti-social... I'm an artist. A really good portrait artist! I'm not a loser after all!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't think that won me any points with the judge...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Whoops! That didn't go so well.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">They aren't, are they...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't think that won me any points with the judge...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!</line>
