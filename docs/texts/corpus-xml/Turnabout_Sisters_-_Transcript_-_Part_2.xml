<title>Turnabout Sisters</title>

<line speaker="Judge">The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defense is ready, Your Honor. <thought>Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may call your first witness.* <thought>[sic]; changed to If we may call our first witness, Your Honor in the iOS and 3DS remakes</thought> The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And the cause of death?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court accepts the statue as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>They're still calling it a "statue"...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now, Detective...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-yes sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm. Detective Gumshoe, Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!</line>
<line speaker="There were two people there already">The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-yes, Your Honor. <thought>Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Something the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Who did you say you got a call from?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.</thought> Right. Please continue.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">There were two people there already:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-that's pretty fast!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you absolutely sure it was us?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why's that? What's your reason?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Why? We had a witness account describing her!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hold on just one second!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-yeah?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I heard you say it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You did say it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">... Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Gah!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And did you find any evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I got a bad feeling about this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-who? Um...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She was framed!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah... <thought>Urk!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Argh...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Argh...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It... it could have been me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What! S-so it was you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Of course I do, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What kind of "tests" were these again?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-yeah?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh? Oh hoh hoh.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That was a mess...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Right! Where was I?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm... she WAS right handed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hah hah hah! Nice try!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This isn't a movie, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oof!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's talk about reality, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That didn't go so well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Th-that's right! What he said!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You have it backwards, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">B-backwards?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-when...!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh. Right.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It was the day after the murder...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm... sorry, I forgot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hah! Forgot, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh. R-right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The prosecution's point being...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-what!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">N-no way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? I-I thought...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Urp!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">W-what? B-but... *sigh*</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Urp!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">W-what? B-but... *sigh*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Darn! This isn't good!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Witness, your name, please.</line>
<line speaker="April">April May! At your service! *wink*</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wonton * <thought>[sic]; changed to wanton in the 3DS remake</thought> winking!</line>
<line speaker="April">Aww... Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?</line>
<line speaker="April">Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And this hotel is directly across from the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices?</line>
<line speaker="April">Mmm... that's right, big boy.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Please testify to the court about what you saw.</line>
<line speaker="April">It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What about my cross-examination!?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-hey! How dare you!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. <thought>If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Wh-what? That's it!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait! Hold on!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes yes yes! <thought>I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="April">It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why did you do that?</line>
<line speaker="April">Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?</line>
<line speaker="April">Oh, well, um... gee!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Let's see how far I can run with this...</thought> Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!</line>
<line speaker="April">I... oooh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">B-badgering?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Poor girl!? What about poor me!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You looked out the window. What did you see next?</line>
<line speaker="April">And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?</line>
<line speaker="April">Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Your... thing?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And the person attacking her?</line>
<line speaker="April">The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How do you know she was the defendant?</line>
<line speaker="April">Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>He's right...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So then, tell us what happened to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="April">Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She "dodged"? Dodged what!?</line>
<line speaker="April">Well... the attack!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please, continue your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="April">But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How did you know it was my client!?</line>
<line speaker="April">Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>She has a point...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!</line>
<line speaker="April">W-what!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Did you really see the defendant at all!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?</line>
<line speaker="April">Urp!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="April">Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!</line>
<line speaker="April">...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!</line>
<line speaker="April">But... but!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?</line>
<line speaker="April">Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="April">I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your testimony again, if you would.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Damn, I almost had her!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">I did see everything! I did!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="April">I did see everything! I did!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, you saw me then, too?</line>
<line speaker="April">Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Spiky...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.</line>
<line speaker="April">Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well... continue.</line>
<line speaker="April">The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Is that "right" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?</line>
<line speaker="April">Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.</line>
<line speaker="April">Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How convenient for you to remember her "hippie" clothes!</line>
<line speaker="April">That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>*sigh*...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">What happened then?</line>
<line speaker="April">And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Where did this weapon come from?</line>
<line speaker="April">She picked it up from the desk!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. What sort of weapon was it?</line>
<line speaker="April">That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A... clock? <thought>Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.</line>
<line speaker="April">Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!</line>
<line speaker="April">Urp!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?</line>
<line speaker="April">Oooh... urp!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! <thought>Well, only once...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">Huh? What? So... what happens now?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?</line>
<line speaker="April">What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, you've been to the law offices of Fey &amp; Co.!</line>
<line speaker="April">N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The law offices of Fey &amp; Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, Your Honor! <thought>I can't give up now!</thought> I'm not satisfied because...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have proof that she could not?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The prosecution denies your request!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-what!? On what grounds?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. Objection sustained.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That clock is missing its clockwork!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H-how could you possibly...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just have a look... As soon as you can!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">See anything interesting, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It is as the defense says!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You "think"?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">See anything interesting, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The batteries on that clock must be dead!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">"Must be," Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... very well. ... Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Your Honor? Are they...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!</line>
<line speaker="April">F-fat!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Miss May?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tsk tsk.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I have proof.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-what!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you say to that?</line>
<line speaker="April">W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I don't rightly understand either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ho hoh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh... I think I blew it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-sorry, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Take a look at this!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="April">Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">*grumble* <thought>The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.</thought> Let's hear the conversation.</line>
<line speaker="Cellular">*beep*</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]</line>
<line speaker="Cellular">*beep*</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!</line>
<line speaker="April">Muh... muh... muh!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?</line>
<line speaker="April">... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... <thought>Wait a second!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then, the court would like--</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, yes, well...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Here is undeniable proof!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!</line>
<line speaker="April">W-whaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!</line>
<line speaker="April">I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?</line>
<line speaker="April">Mmpf...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh? Excuses not on sale today?</line>
<line speaker="April">Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!</line>
<line speaker="April">Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>S-scary...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?</line>
<line speaker="April">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Okay, this is it!</thought> Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.</thought> Miss May held that very clock in her hands!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! When was this!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">When she used it to strike the victim! When else?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-what's that supposed to mean!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh... <thought>Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>S-she can't prove it! She did it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">It would be MY pleasure!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">N-no way!</line>
<line speaker="April">Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-sorry, Your Honor. <thought>That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!</thought> Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defendant's cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, we've seen that already.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.</line>
<line speaker="Cellular">*beep*</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Again? What's it this time?]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Have a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="April">Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I found this in Miss May's room.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?</line>
<line speaker="April">I... I...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, this is ridiculous!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.</line>
<line speaker="April">La... laaa... lrrrrgf!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?</line>
<line speaker="April">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss May!</line>
<line speaker="April">Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!</line>
<line speaker="April">I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="April">Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?</line>
<line speaker="April">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Answer the question!</line>
<line speaker="April">Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.</thought> Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point. Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?</line>
<line speaker="April">At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Have a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="April">Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I found this in Miss May's room.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?</line>
<line speaker="April">Oooh. Oooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, This is irrelevant!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Absolutely!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if that was the case, <thought>which it's not</thought> you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">WHAAAAT!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This! I think...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait! That was just a warm up!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I present the defendant's cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, we've seen that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Cellular">*beep*</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Again? What's it this time?]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>

<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What does it reveal, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">She "heard"...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defendant's cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, we've seen that already.</line>

<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss May!</line>
<line speaker="April">What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You killed her, didn't you!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! There will be order!</line>
<line speaker="April">What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So you admit you tapped her phone!</line>
<line speaker="April">Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Really? Can you prove it!? <thought>No way can she prove it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You can't be serious! No way!</line>
<line speaker="April">Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">R-room service!?</line>
<line speaker="April">Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-ice coffee...!?</line>
<line speaker="April">Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, where does that leave us...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why did you tap her phone?</line>
<line speaker="April">...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Answer the question!</line>
<line speaker="April">Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.</thought> Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point. Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Damn... she's good!</thought></line>
<line speaker="April">Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You can't be serious! No way!</line>
<line speaker="April">Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...</line>

<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Have a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="April">Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I found this in Miss May's room.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?</line>
<line speaker="April">Oooh. Oooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, This is irrelevant!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Absolutely!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if that was the case, <thought>which it's not</thought> you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">WHAAAAT!?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This! I think...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait! That was just a warm up!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I present the defendant's cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, we've seen that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Cellular">*beep*</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]</line>
<line speaker="Maya">[Again? What's it this time?]</line>
<line speaker="Mia">[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?</line>
<line speaker="April">I... I...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, this is ridiculous!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.</line>
<line speaker="April">La... laaa... lrrrrgf!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?</line>
<line speaker="April">...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss May!</line>
<line speaker="April">Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!</line>

<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is my evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, does the defense have anything to say?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, well... <thought>Come on, think of something!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!</line>
<line speaker="April">I think you've sunken quite low enough already.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I object to calling the bellboy!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-why? What's your reason?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Condition...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!</thought> Understood. I accept your condition.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh!</thought> Uh... um, wait...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Grr! I can't accept those conditions!</thought> Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Right. On with the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">None, Your Honor. She's the last.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?</thought> W-wait! Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!</thought> I accept!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Right. On with the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">None, Your Honor. She's the last.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?</thought> W-wait! Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!</thought> I accept!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Very good, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">R-right! I'm ready. <thought>I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What exactly is it you do at the hotel?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you always so... so prim?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Absolutely, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-how can you be so certain!?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, what then?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">9:00 "on the dot," you say?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>9:00... the time of the murder!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"Precisely" 9:00, then?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How can you be so sure!?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Why would she be so particular about the time?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You are sure it was Miss April May herself?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Ab-SO-lutely, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"Ab-SO-lutely"...?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How come you're so very certain!?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-why would she have done that...?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I can't let this happen... can I?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">W-wait! Please wait!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes? Does the defense have something to add?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">One last question... let me ask one last question!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see...&#160;? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...! What did he say!?</thought> What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">T-tell me again about er... room service!</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...! What did he say!?</thought> What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see. Thank you. ... <thought>Pillows... for two!?</thought> Bellboy! What did you just say?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I object! That was... objectionable!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Er... yes, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Nice try!</thought> That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">!</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oof! Y-you fool!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I've done it... I've won!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">Yes, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?</line>
<line speaker="Bellboy">That's right, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who! Who is this "other person"!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Simple, it was...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">None other than Miss April May!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh... right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It was the bellboy and none other!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, this comes as some surprise...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But what if they were in cahoots!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You have evidence of this?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um... no, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The man who checked in with Miss May!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oof!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">R-really?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I think I might be your newest fan!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... if you say so.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh... I see.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But I got a great lead in today's trial!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">A "lead"?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That man with Miss May! He's the key!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yes sir!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm going to find out more about this man.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Do you think he was the one who...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe so.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sis...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I'm counting on you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Whoops! That didn't go so well.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Uh... I'm not sure I follow?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't think that won me any points with the judge...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">They aren't, are they...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>I don't think that won me any points with the judge...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!</line>
