<title>The Adventure of the Clouded Kokoro</title>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Well, I never expected this. Who'd have thought we'd be back here again so soon?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We are on a study tour of Great Britain...with the intention of learning the country's legal practices. In order to research the latest court procedures here, we need as much court experience as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, yes, I suppose that's true, but... ...for the person in the dock, it may well be his or her one and only time in court. And it could be life-changing. In which case, treating it  as 'research' may seem a little... crass.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Oh, when you put it like that... You're quite right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Mr Natsume. Good morning.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, are you alright? Your eyes are terribly bloodshot.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">'The early bird catches the worm,' as they say here in Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I've heard that expression.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">But I really don't want to catch a worm. SO I TRIED DESPERATELY NOT TO WAKE UP EARLY! BUT I WAS SO WORRIED, I COULDN'T CATCH A WINK! ...And now I'm absolutely exhausted as a result.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Do all literary people take things so...literally?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Thank you for putting your faith in us today, Mr Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... I, I WISH I HAD NINE LIVES! MY WHOLE FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE! I'M...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Really? Because I can feel tremors in the floor.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">I can't do this! I can't take it! Although...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...yes?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">I caught a glimpse of the public gallery as I walked by the courtroom. It looked like the opening night of the opera, there were so many people. I had no idea my case was such a notorious affair here in London.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. Um... <thought>Neither did I.</thought> Do you know why that might be, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo, but I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So that all-knowing look on your face is just coincidence then, is it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">DON'T HIDE THE TRUTH FROM ME! ...It's...it's... ...it's because of the Reaper, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>Lord van Zieks?!</thought> Is, is that right, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I purchased as many different newspapers as I could find this morning, and yes... ...Lord van Zieks is on the front page of every one.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I knew it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Sometime after the prosecutor was dubbed 'The Reaper of the Bailey'... ...he stopped appearing in court, it seems. It's been several years now, in fact, until the day before yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, Inspector Gregson told us something similar, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe that appearance made even greater waves here in the capital than today's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But we wouldn't have realised, of course, having only just arrived in the country.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'Why is the Reaper back in the Bailey so soon, for what appears to be a mundane murder?' That's the question the papers are asking. And they are all speculating various answers.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">'Mundane'? MUNDANE?! It's the most significant saga of the century to some of us!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear! I meant no offence, Mr Natsume! But...that is how the papers are describing it.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Well, lest we also forget the fact that it could spark an international incident. Obviously, the reappearance of this infamous prosecutor has caught people's attention. But there's another blatant similarity with the trial of two days ago.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I agree.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire... It's you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Me...? <thought>Well, I suppose that's true.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Both times, it is you who stands against this legendary prosecutor. It, it can only mean...THAT YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THE REAPER!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please! I don't rub shoulders with...with...death-bringers!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid that there's really only one other explanation. It can only be another example, Mr Naruhodo, of your uncommon bad luck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Thanks for that.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh, this is just my luck! Why must I be represented by a man with such frail fortune? By the LEAST LUCKY LAWYER ALIVE!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, let's not forget... ...that it was you, Mr Natsume, who asked me to represent you.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's true that I'm just a student, new to London, with little in the way of experience or skills...or luck. But I promise you this... ...I will fight your corner until the bitter end. And I will believe in you, Mr Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh, benevolent Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're not alone here with us, Mr Natsume. Whatever happens, we will always be on your side!</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh, benevolent Non-Locum Assistant Miss Mikotoba Esquiress... ......... I AM IN YOUR DEBT! FOREVER! I shall never forget this great kindness for as long as I live!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Mr Natsume! Counsel for the Defence! The court session is about to begin. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then, Mr Natsume, it's time. Let's go.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Y-Y-Ye... Y-Y-Ye... YEEESSSSSS!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This is it... My second appearance in a British courtroom. And my second trial against...the Reaper. I hope you're watching over me, Kazuma. Because this time, I won't let my faith waver. I'll believe in my client to the last. Just like you believed in me... ...I believe I can do this now! I'm ready for this fight!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution is fully prepared, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence...is ready, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... The Nipponese are a truly fascinating breed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, what?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Lord Stronghart has told me all about you. That you are a student who arrived in London but two days ago. A mere amateur.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do, do you have a point?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Being a compatriot, you feel compelled to try to help the accused, I suppose. ...Typical Nipponese arrogance.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Forgive me, but I do not believe arrogance is an appropriate description.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Susato-san...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">After all, at our previous encounter, the defendant was found to be innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Very true. And a most fascinating - if dark - trial it was, too. The tragic conclusion came later, of course. Here's to the acquitted, and his unfortunate violent end.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsels. I see both sides are in fine fettle. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are you ready to carry out your duties here in court as impartial members of the public?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">You never know when you might be down on your luck. But I believe in fair play for everyone.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Well I must warn you, I'm rather more ruthless than I appear.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh well, not me. What you see is what you get. I'm a peace-loving fellow.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I'm afraid to say, I think it's quite possible that moustached foreigner did the deed.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Come on, what are we waiting for? No doubt he did it, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Eh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, let us proceed. Your opening statement, if you please, Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Very recently, Great Britain signed an alliance with a rising power in the Far East. The accused in the dock today is a student from that same land. A certain Mr Soseki Natsume. And while our country has extended this foreign student the warmest of welcomes... ...regrettably the kindness has not been returned. In fact, this student is accused of a most sinister act. Of plunging a knife into the back of an innocent woman who was doing nothing but walking down the street!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">A knife crime?! I tell you from bitter experience, those are the worst! Bloody oath, they are!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Just look at that sallow complexion and short stature... He's, he's one of those dreadful 'Japanese'!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Come on, let's get this over with. With me now, everyone. One, two...three!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Eh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Pray...forgive the discourtesy of smashing my hallowed chalice here in this great chamber. Allow me to call the first witness to the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Bailiff, lead the inspector in, please!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your name and occupation, please.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, sir. Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Would you please summarise the events of the case for the court, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The victim is thought to be a young woman in her twenties by the name of Olive Green.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I beg your pardon, Inspector? 'Thought to be'?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, havin' been stabbed in the back by her attacker's knife, the victim fell unconscious. That was three days ago now. And she's been comatose ever since.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! <thought>So they don't even know who she is for sure?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, comatose... I see. But her life is not in danger?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Fortunately for the Eastern student, the charge will not be murder. Pray, elaborate on the details, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Sir. If I could ask everyone to look at this street map... As I mentioned, the incident took place three days ago. ...At around five in the afternoon. It happened on the pavement running alongside Briar Road, a wide thoroughfare for horse-drawn vehicles. It had not long since stopped snowin' as the victim - Miss Green - was walkin' down the street. Out of the blue, she was approached from behind by the accused and stabbed in the back. Luckily, the young lady's life was spared, and she's currently bein' treated in one of the city's hospitals. But bein' unconscious as she is, we've been unable to take a statement from her, of course. This is the case file with everything we know about the victim so far.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Inspector. The court will accept the documents as evidence, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What of the weapon that was used?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Sir. I have that here. It was removed from the victim's back.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ouch. That big thing is starting to make me scared to walk down the street now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">With a heavy blade like that, almost anybody would have been able to stab the poor woman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Even the scragged-looking Soseki-san, I suppose...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... A common-or-garden jackknife, I would say. Rather nondescript. Thank you, Inspector. The court accepts the blade as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then...what do we know of the motive? Money or valuables, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, look here, Mr Naruhodo, just at the tip... A small piece of the blade appears to be missing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're right! Well spotted, Miss Susato!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder what could have happened to it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. ...You, you don't think... ...it could still be lodged in the victim, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear! I do hope not. That sounds terribly painful.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">From what we can tell by looking at the woman's possessions, it seems like she's a poor student herself. Hard to imagine she would have had anythin' much worth pinchin', My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. Well, in that case, are we looking at some deep-seated resentment toward the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...I'm afraid I couldn't say. Apart from visitin' secondhand bookshops, the defendant, Mr Natsume, doesn't appear to get out much. At this moment in time, we haven't been able to establish any sort of connection between him and the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Scotland Yard does not arrest people without good cause. That should be beyond question. Inspector Gregson, the prosecution calls for your formal testimony. Explain to the court precisely why the constabulary came to arrest the Nipponese student.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">As I said, it was five o'clock in the afternoon when the incident occurred. And there was an unusually light fog.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Old books, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, My Lord. I have a photograph here of the scene of the crime, taken immediately after the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah yes, I can clearly see the books to which you are referring. I will take that photographic print as evidence, please, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You Nipponese are a spineless breed. Too cowardly to admit defeat. Denying everything despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but the defendant is not denying 'everything', as you put it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you doing, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do go on...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Natsume has admitted to playing some part in the incident. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Well, now you mention it... ...when we visited him in the prison yesterday, he did tell us what had all happened.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">As I was walking along that accursed pavement, I could make out the sole silhouette of another ahead of me. A woman, wearing a green overcoat, she was. And just as I went to overtake her... ...she suddenly let out a little scream, and collapsed onto the cold, hard slabs of stone at my feet! I was terrified! I had to get away from there! So I ran! As fast as my legs would carry me back to my accursed lodgings!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Hmph, a green overcoat?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well that's exactly what the woman in that print is wearing!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh my! A photographic print in full colour! What will the world come up with next?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defendant has done nothing more than admit he fled the scene of a terrifying incident! That does NOT mean that he's guilty of the heinous crime of stabbing the woman in the back!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There was nobody else there at the time. Just the two of them: the victim...and the accused. In other words, there is nobody else who could possibly have stabbed the woman. A fact...that the accused concedes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, it seems this cross-examination could prove to be pivotal, Counsel. Proceed, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord! <thought>Nothing for it... I have to use this cross-examination to turn the tables here. It's our only chance!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">As I said, it was five o'clock in the afternoon when the incident occurred. And there was an unusually light fog.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A light fog, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, light for London. You could see the opposite side of the street for once. Not much farther, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's light, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Around these parts, yes. Not something I'd expect a Japanese fellow like yourself to know, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've read that London is famous for its fog. But in my country, people usually imagine that gives the city a rather beautiful appearance.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tsk. How quaint.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, well, it's not somethin' us Londoners tend to romanticise, as I expect you can appreciate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">At this time of year, the fog causes a large number of accidents, especially when it's heavy. Sometimes you can't even see your own hand at the end of your arm.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. The other day, I was very nearly trampled by horses before I could see the carriage they were pulling.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... Susato-san and I should definitely remember to stop, look and listen...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">However, on the day that concerns us, the fog was somewhat lighter than usual. A fact no doubt lamented by the accused.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Visibility was reasonably good, and there was no one else about but the victim and the accused.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How are you able to state that with any certainly?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Quite simply, my learned friend. Because that is what the witnesses to this crime have told us.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ah yes, Inspector Gregson mentioned the witnesses yesterday, didn't he?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. One of them is a policeman, I believe. From Scotland Yard.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That is correct, ma'am.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then we must hear their testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution will of course call them to the stand... should it be necessary.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, wait a minute! At five o'clock in the afternoon in the middle of winter... it would have been dark already! No matter how light the fog might have been, no one could have seen-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I'm unaware of the situation on your tiny island in the East... ...but here in the capital city of Great Britain...all main roads are illuminated in the night by gas streetlights.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution believes there would have been ample light by which to witness the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Quite. Here in London, for the first time in history, mankind has completely conquered the darkness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Which means we really need to hear those witness statements. If I could just get through the fog of this cross-examination, maybe we'll be able to...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It seems the counsel for the defence is...taking stock. Continue with your testimony, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Out of the blue, the victim was stabbed from behind and subsequently collapsed on the pavement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'From behind', you say...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. As you can see from this print.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Yes, quite so, Inspector. The handle of the weapon is clearly protruding from the victim's back. And you say this poor woman - Miss Green - remains in a critical condition? Comatose, no less?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm afraid so, My Lord, yes. She's bein' treated at Barts. I was hopeful that she'd come round before the trial started so I could take a statement, but it wasn't to be.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, that is indeed a pity. It would have been most illuminating to hear the victim's own account of events.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Luck is on your client's side, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! On the contrary! My client has been exceedingly UNlucky!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Your force of tone is seriously undermined by those disturbingly wide eyes, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Natsume's belongings? Um...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I think you'll find it's all there in the photographic print of the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, the three books on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right, My Lord. Secondhand books, they were. Irreparably damaged after fallin' in the snow, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The accused could easily have carried all three books in one hand. Which means... ...his other hand would have been free to wield a knife, for example.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He's very clever, isn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He's made it extremely hard for you to assert that Mr Natsume had his hands full with his books. He's managed to close the one avenue of escape we might have had before we even knew it was there.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You mean to say that the defendant was holding his belongings as he thrust the knife into the woman's back?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That must be what happened, My Lord, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Those bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defendant apparently visits a secondhand bookshop on a daily basis.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, so I understand. A shop full of old English literature.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I commend the accused on the lofty subject matter of his scholarly attention.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The bloke's room was stacked floor to ceilin' with those musty old books.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can you tell us more about the bookshop in question, please, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, if I must. I'll have to ask you to look at the street map again, I'm afraid. The closest secondhand bookshop to the accused's lodgings is this place here. Bourbon Books. A little place on the corner of Briar Road and Meerschaum Street. As it happens, the accused is currently livin' in lodgings on the other side of Briar Road at the opposite end. Which means it doesn't take a genius to work out the route he would've taken home. Somethin' like this.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, I concur with your conclusion, Inspector. The defendant would certainly have passed the scene of the crime on his way home from that particular shop.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that what the inspector just told us could turn out to be of vital importance.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I agree. <thought>The most important point that the inspector just made being...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The crucial detail in what you've just told the court, Inspector, is the location of the bookshop.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I couldn't agree more.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...where is it exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Eh? Are you windin' me up, sunshine?! I just explained that! I got the map out and everythin'! Used red bloomin' ink! And drew the bloke's route home on for you!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And I distinctly remember seeing you nod along, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Yes...yes, of course! <thought>I must have been so nervous, I didn't take it in...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The blunder of the day goes to you, my learned friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, not yet! The trial's only just begun after all!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...I would strongly advise you to look carefully through the Court Record at this stage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, miss. At once, miss. Sorry I made a mistake, miss.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Inspector, continue with your testimony, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson, may I ask you a favour?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you kindly add the name of the bookshop to your formal testimony, please? I believe it may be of vital importance.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">'May be'?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, well, you know... I mean, yes! It could be a very important clue!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Not that I can see it being of any great significance... ...but please revise your testimony accordingly, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes sir, My Lord. Whatever you say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Could the man BE any more sardonic?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I often think, Inspector... ...that what really makes for a good bookshop is the quality of the books that they stock!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Yes, I think I'd agree with that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For example! You go to a shop and buy a serialised set of novels... ...but when you return home, you find to your horror... that the third volume is missing!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Doesn't bear thinkin' about. Just the sort of thing that really gets my goat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly! THAT is the point I was trying to make!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well, now that you two have found common ground in that fascinating scenario... ...perhaps we might continue with the cross-examination? If you're quite finished, my learned Nipponese friend?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! ......... <thought>...Wait, what just happened?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">What just happened, Mr Naruhodo, was that you allowed yourself to be sidetracked. I would strongly advise you to look carefully through the Court Record at this stage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, miss. At once, miss. Sorry I made a mistake, miss.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">He was on his way home from Bourbon Books, a secondhand bookshop he apparently patronises.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, so the shop is called Bourbon Books, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. That's the closest secondhand bookshop to the accused's lodgings. And to get from there back to his room... ...he would have gone right past the very spot where the incident took place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If...if I could just confirm one point... Can we be sure that the defendant really did visit Bourbon Books on the day in question?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Well, we haven't actually confirmed it, no.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You haven't confirmed it? Why the devil not, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, um, the thing is... ...the shopkeeper's gone on a trip, you see. Left the mornin' after the incident. To collect more stock, I'm told. So we, um, haven't been able to ask the bloke if the accused visited his shop on the day in question or not.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well in that case, what did the defendant himself have to say about it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...No recollection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">According to the statement he made at the time, the accused has no recollection of where he'd been.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Of course he doesn't.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The bloke clearly has his head in the clouds whenever he's walkin' about town. He claims he just wanders into whatever bookshop he happens to be passin', and rarely notices the name.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... I should say the man ought to learn to look where he's going, at the very least.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>So... ...it's just as I thought, then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is something the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Inspector, you may continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">It was just a matter of workin' out who the books belonged to, and we found the bloke to arrest him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You asked for the help of the famous detective, Herlock Sholmes, to locate the defendant, I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Stuff and nonsense.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That Jack-in-office...that busybody...just comes and sticks his oar in whether we ask him or not!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but according to what I have here... ...Mr Sholmes was shown to the scene by Scotland Yard detectives.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well that was nothin' to do with me! The lads at the scene must've done it! Without my permission!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I tell 'em time and again! Whenever somethin' happens, send word to headquarters! Then follow your bloomin' instructions!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">If that meddler gets his hands on any details, we'll all be readin' it in Randst Magazine next month! And you can bet your last farthin' that I'll be in there, too, stripped of all my hard work on the case! 'Yes, Mr Sholmes, no, Mr Sholmes', 'Aren't you clever, Mr Sholmes'! That's all the thanks I'll be gettin'!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Inspector. If the man is proving detrimental to the Yard's activities... ...perhaps I should step in and...deal with him?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Argh!!! .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It appears Inspector Gregson is lost for words.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. The Reaper's words carry a lot of weight, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Anyway, the point is this! That little Japanese bloke's already admitted it. He's admitted that those books all over the pavement at the scene were the ones he bought that day!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think, Mr Naruhodo? If you're unable to sway the jury during this cross-examination, I'm afraid-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That Mr Natsume's fate will be sealed? Yes, they're sure to find him guilty. So one way or another... ...I have to expose an undeniable inconsistency in the inspector's testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...if, if I could just stop you there, Inspector Gregson...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What is it, sunshine? I'm a busy man, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is a receipt that we found in Mr Natsume's room. It was issued on the day of the incident, and details the purchase of three secondhand books.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">And you found that in the accused's room, did you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but the point is not where the receipt was found, but the name of the shop printed on it.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Go on.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This receipt was issued from a bookshop called...Yore Books.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yore Books? Y-o-r-e, I presume...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. So Mr Natsume did indeed purchase a number of books at a secondhand bookshop that day. However! The bookshop in question...was not Bourbon Books!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh? What?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Inspector! Do you know of this other bookshop?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Y-Yes sir! Yore Books is another secondhand bookshop not far from Bourbon Books. It's just that... Well, it's such a small place, I, I didn't think the accused would have known about it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But in fact that IS the bookshop which the defendant visited on the day in question. And this receipt proves it!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I disagree! I, I mean...after all, um...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I have the street map here, if that might be of help?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um... Yes! Thank you! Have a look at this, please... If the defendant had been returning from Bourbon Books... ...then yes, he would almost certainly have passed the place where Miss Green was attacked. However! If we take into account the fact that he was actually at another bookshop - Yore Books... ...it may very well turn out that he wouldn't have passed that location at all!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...! Could that be true?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My my, it rather depends on where this other bookshop is, but I do declare it may be a possibility...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Is that right, Mr Lawyer, sir? What you just said?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Absolutely! It absolutely could be right!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Inspector Gregson! Where is this Yore Books establishment?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, um, obviously we looked into that. It turns out that Yore Books... ...is just here on the next corner of Meerschaum Street goin' east.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And there you have it! As you can clearly see now... ......... ...Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...My learned Nipponese friend is obviously in training to be a clown, the way he regales us with such witticisms. To your future career in the circus.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Grrr...you put that glass down now, or I'll put it down for you!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I, erm...didn't think I needed to spell it out, but here we go. If the accused was comin' home from Yore Books instead of Bourbon Books... ...there's no doubt he still would have passed the place where the victim was stabbed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, thank you, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to reiterate for my learned, if somewhat slow, Nipponese friend... Wherever the man purchased his musty tomes, it makes no difference in the final analysis.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">As I suspected! You can't fool me! And I don't suggest you try!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">What did I say, eh? I've had enough of this now!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Beg your pardon? Terribly sorry, but would you mind repeating that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! We mustn't give up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What, what do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If the prosecution's assertion is correct... ...the members of the jury may very well decide that Mr Natsume is guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! <thought>She's absolutely right!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must think! We must consider the assertion just put forward by the prosecution very, very carefully!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>They claim Soseki-san must have passed the location of the incident on his way home from Yore Books, but...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The assertion just made by the prosecution...is fundamentally flawed!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I think I'd better leave it alone for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, if the defence has no rebuttal here...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, as I said before... ...we can't give up here. We must fight back!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I realise that. But sometimes the best way to fight is to do nothing, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You're right! What am I talking about? Doing nothing won't get us anywhere! <thought>It wasn't sitting right with me anyway...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The assertion just made by the prosecution...is fundamentally flawed!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, remember! It's time to fight back!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh, I don't know what's worse, the court penalty, or Susato-san's piercing stare...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Explain yourself, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm, yes, My Lord! You, you can see what I mean on this map! When returning from Yore Books to his lodgings... ...Mr Natsume could have followed the route suggested by the prosecution. However... ...that isn't the only conceivable route to take between the two places. If the defendant used these streets...look what happens! He arrives back at his lodgings without passing the location where the victim was attacked!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On a cold winter's night, why would any man choose to take a longer route home?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, um...erm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The answer is extremely simple: He wouldn't. In other words... ...the accused took the obvious route back to his lodgings, and is the obvious perpetrator of this crime!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...but...BUT! Ah-ha, yes! I've got it! Obviously, we must ask the man himself! Ask Mr Natsume which route he took home!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I have already informed the court of the accused's response to such questioning. He claims he has 'no recollection'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. As I said, the bloke seems to spend his time outside wanderin' aimlessly from A to B. That day was no exception. He says he doesn't remember where he was or which route he took home.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I don't... I DON'T BELIEVE THIIIS!!!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...I thank you, my learned friend. And suggest that we do not waste any more of the court's time by wandering aimlessly around this subject. Pray, what say you insightful jurors?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but even if that is the case, the defence still-</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I agree with Lord van Zieks! Wholeheartedly, and in every way!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! <thought>I don't believe it! Does, does this mean...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">We members of the jury...are completely convinced now!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, in that case I hereby call upon all members of the jury... ...to present your findings to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It would appear the jury's leaning is unanimous.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">To the insightful members of the jury. I applaud your brave resolve. You serve Queen and country admirably.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>No...not yet... This isn't over yet! I still have one last chance to sway the opinion of the jury. I have to tip the balance of those scales the other way. I have to turn this around... ...somehow!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hm, those are the eyes of quarry not yet willing to give up and die.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So I presume you intend to wield your rights again in this trial. Rights of the defence written into antiquated British law that should have been buried long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Call it antiquated if you will... ...but it's the defence's prerogative to carry out a summation examination if it so chooses!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Counsel... ...in accordance with the letter of the law, we shall proceed with a summation examination. Are the members of the jury ready, Mr Foreman?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Of course we're ready! I'm all too familiar with that Nipponese whippersnapper and his onkus refusal to throw in his alley.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">For pity's sake, that little Nipponese oddity already admitted it himself, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If he said that a woman in green collapsed before his eyes, why it can only have been the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop. Not in winter!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">So the poor woman was attacked from behind, was she? How dreadful!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I really don't care! Can't we just wrap this up now? I've got work to be doing!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm, Yore Books, yes... Nice shop, that. But Bourbon Books? ...Hmph, no, not worth a visit.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... With only minor exceptions, the reasons for finding the defendant guilty are all too clear.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When the stabbing occurred, the only two people at the scene were the victim and the accused. And the accused himself... ...has admitted to seeing the victim in her green overcoat sink to the ground before his eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Furthermore, we have heard from the inspector that the defendant then fled the scene. I must say, I would have ample grounds to convict this man already.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, even the judge appears convinced of Mr Natsume's guilt now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, why did he have to run away like that? And how are we supposed to believe in some phantom attacker that nobody could see? This is impossible! How can I possibly make a case for the defence?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! This is no time for grumbling! If we want to force the trial to continue-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I know. I have to turn the tide. I must make the jurors change their minds. Well, four of them, at least.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Exactly. We have no choice but to forge forward!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You have the floor, Counsel. Begin your summation examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. <thought>I just need to keep this trial going somehow. Whatever it takes... Come on, Ryunosuke, you can do it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">For pity's sake, that little Nipponese oddity already admitted it himself, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, excuse me, but... ...aren't you...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yes, that's right. I was in the witness stand myself just two days ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I had a feeling I knew your face. ...Or the side of it, anyway. If I remember correctly, you're a banker, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">That's right. After the gold rush down under, I came back to London to work. And it was all going swimmingly until you started fossicking around! Bruce Fairplay was a man of repute!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Don't think I've forgotten how you treated me the other day! You had me and that young hatter pegged as criminals!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, well, you know... Water under the bridge!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now there's all sorts of rumours buzzing around. And the police have been badgering me nonstop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...If, if I could turn back the clock...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Well anyway, I don't know about the hatter, but at least I'm in the clear now. And free to make up my own mind about who's guilty and who isn't.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... Thank goodness... <thought>Alright, maaaybe I might struggle to change this man's mind, given our awkward history...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, I wonder what's become of Mr Furst now...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If he said that a woman in green collapsed before his eyes, why it can only have been the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're right that at the time of the incident... ...the defendant admits to having seen someone wearing a green overcoat walking ahead of him.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Well quite! That's precisely my point. Clearly that 'someone wearing green' was the victim. And clearly that funny little Nipponese man with the disturbing moustache is the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But let us not forget, madam! The defendant vehemently denies attacking the woman!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Why, of course he does! If he admits to stabbing her, his life is over. The man is obviously a liver-faced coward. Honestly! Claiming the woman simply collapsed before his eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if that's a lie as you're suggesting, do you not think he would have concocted something more credible?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh, I really couldn't say. After all, you are...foreign. Who's to say what goes through your funny little minds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I could tell you what's going through my funny little mind right now, but you wouldn't like it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I do declare the man has already made the admission. He himself has stated that there was nobody else around. Surely the conclusion is obvious? No one else could possibly have committed this awful crime!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If no one else could have done it, the accused must be the man. Really, it couldn't be more simple!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your argument is compelling in its simplicity, I must admit.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my! You are too kind, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That went well...for her.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, juror number two? Juror number six?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My, whatever do you mean, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">But the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can we really be sure of that, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My! Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was wearing a green overcoat and who fell over on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">My goodness, you, you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Are, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well look at that!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">My goodness me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry? You need a pee?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And crucially! We know precisely where the old man in the green overcoat fell!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">On Calabash Road...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oooh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">And really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">What did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My Lord, I do hope it won't cause any inconvenience, but...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You'd like to change your leaning, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I do declare that I would. I should like to call for a verdict of not guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">And I would too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Is it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do! <thought>Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. On with the summation examination, please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Is it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Why it could have been that old man in the green that the defendant saw. I have to call not guilty. It's only right.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop. Not in winter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But you can't deny that there are other routes Mr Natsume could have taken back from Yore Books.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh yes. Like you drew on the map, you mean? What was it? Calabash Road or something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Precisely.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">But it seems to me that what counts is whether the little Japanese fellow actually went that way or not.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes, that's true.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">And at the moment, there's no proof that shows he did, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes, that's true as well.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">And as I understand it, the accused himself doesn't remember which way he went, does he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes, that's annoyingly true.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Winter nights are dark and cold, so the way I see it, you'd want to get home as quickly as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes... Haah...why is all this true?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">So really, the only thing that makes sense is that he went home along Briar Road.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! <thought>I'm supposed to be convincing you here!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I have given it a lot of thought, you know. I didn't just make up my mind on a whim that he did it. I mean, if there was some logical reason why he might have gone the Calabash Road way, it'd be different. I'd be happy to reconsider my position in that case. Honest, I would.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, a reason why Soseki-san might have taken the longer way home...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, a good reason... I don't imagine you'll be able to sway this young man's opinion without one.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements are clearly at odds with one another!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">At odds, Counsel? Explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Please! Don't point! It wasn't me, I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? What? I, I just want to get this done and dusted!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, juror number three?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh! Me, sir? What, what do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five's words just now are extremely significant. Let's take a moment to consider the implications of what's been said on our map of the local area. On the day in question, Mr Natsume visited this bookshop to purchase a number of secondhand books. And on the same day... ...we now know that there were works being carried out on Meerschaum Street, making it impassable. Which means that the defendant's route home... ...could not have taken him along Meerschaum Street and down Briar Road.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh! Yes! Of course! What, what do you think, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well! Yes, you can't argue with that really, can you? We must've had a good two yards or more of the pavement up. Every gentleman and gentlewoman that came along had to turn back and go the other way.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the only conclusion is this! The defendant must have taken the longer route back to his lodgings!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes, I suppose he must have.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I, I suppose that must be right, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number three, you said the following: 'The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop.' ...But! We see now...that he had no choice!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yeees! ......... My Lord Mr Judge, sir, if I may...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I, I don't think in all good conscience...that I can say the man's guilty now. ......... Yes, I'd like to see this trial continue so we can get to the bottom of what really happened. What about you, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? Who, me? Hm, well, alright then... If there's a hole in the prosecution's argument, it should be filled in, that's what I say.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do! <thought>Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. On with the summation examination, please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements are clearly at odds with one another!</line>

<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I have to say not guilty at this point...so I can see where this trial goes from here.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">So the poor woman was attacked from behind, was she? How dreadful!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Whatever is the matter, young man?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're the wife of Mr Garrideb, aren't you? The landlord who rents Mr Natsume his room.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The master's wife?! Where do you get your ideas, sir? I'm the maid! The maid, you understand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>She's keeping up that charade? ...Ugh, this is going to be awkward.</thought> Erm, why didn't you mention this yesterday? That you'd been selected for the jury in this trial, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well, I was told not to mention it to anyone until the day of the trial, you see. It was in the letter I received. The instructions were very clear. So I'm afraid I had no choice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see. Anyway, Mr Natsume - the defendant - takes lodging in your...master's house, doesn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Yes, that's right. Although he's only been in a little over a week now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And in that time, surely you must have taken stock of his character. Does Mr Natsume look like the kind of man who would commit a crime such as this?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh my goodness me, yes! He's just the sort.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Spending all his time in that dark and dingy room, sporting that unscrupulous moustache... The man never speaks! And don't get me started on those shifty eyes! All the neighbours are talking about him. I've heard them, you know. People think he must be building a bomb in there or something.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, poor Mr Natsume. How could people say such things about him? He's just a harmless bookworm, nothing more.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well, you just called him a worm, so... <thought>Anyway, I'd better be careful about inviting this 'maid' to speak. She's said enough damning things already.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I really don't care! Can't we just wrap this up now? I've got work to be doing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A man's life is on the line here, sir! This will take as long as it takes!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Don't get clever with me now, son! My life's on the line, too. And so is my family's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">The likes of you wouldn't understand, but a labourer like me can't afford to take time off. If I don't work, I don't eat! And neither do the wife and kids!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see. That...must be very hard.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I go to the union every morning to find out what needs doing. If you're late and the work's taken, it's tough. This time of year, there's water and gas supply pipes bursting left, right and centre. They're after cheap labour to get the roads dug up to fix it. It's a hard slog from dawn till dusk, it is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you were out digging up the roads on the day of the incident as well, were you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That's right. In fact, if I remember rightly... ...it was just round the corner from where it all happened. By that old bookshop, it was.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! <thought>Another coincidence?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That's right, Meerschaum Street, it was.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Meerschaum Street...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">On the map, Mr Naruhodo! There are only three named streets!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five! I need you to add that information to your formal statement, please.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">What's the point in that? Can't we just get this business over with now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, sir, it's important!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Tsk, fine, I'll do it then.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">On the day it happened, I was digging up Meerschaum Street from dawn till dusk!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, if I understand correctly, you're a day labourer and you were doing road maintenance that day?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That's right. Like I said, you get a lot of burst gas and water pipes underground in the middle of winter. It's the only time of year fellows like me can actually make a few bob. And I'm missing out today!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...when you say from dawn till dusk...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well the work has to be completed within the day, see. No coaches or pedestrians can pass while it's happening.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder if I could trouble you, sir... ...to mark on this street map the exact location of the works you were carrying out?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Give it here, then. Let me have a look. Right, let's see then... Here we are, Meerschaum Street. Yes, it was just here, like. It was a tidy dig, I can tell you. We had to get through all the drifts of snow that had frozen solid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And at what sort of time did you finish the work?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well, we started in the morning and we can't have finished before gone six, I'd say. The snow had stopped coming down, but it was long past dark for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That means the road work was still going on when Miss Green was attacked at around five o'clock.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Road works on Meerschaum Street, huh...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements are clearly at odds with one another!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">At odds, Counsel? Explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Please! Don't point! It wasn't me, I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? What? I, I just want to get this done and dusted!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, juror number three?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh! Me, sir? What, what do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five's words just now are extremely significant. Let's take a moment to consider the implications of what's been said on our map of the local area.

<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Whether it's digging up roads or digging up the truth, you've got to see it through to the end, haven't you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm, Yore Books, yes... Nice shop, that. But Bourbon Books? ...Hmph, no, not worth a visit.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry? 'Fold it,' you say? Fold what?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Um, no no, what I said was '<cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn>' What I wanted to ask was, do you visit Yore Books often?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I like the old books they have in there, yes. I enjoy reading them over a nice cup of old tea. That's my daily routine, you see. Same thing every day. Including the day you're all talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And at what time did you visit Yore Books on the day in question?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Well, I was picking out books in there all afternoon, and it would have been just before five that I left. That's my daily routine, you see. Same thing every day. Including the day you're all talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just before five, you say? <thought>Exactly when the victim was attacked!</thought> Are you sure about the time?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh yes, no mistake there. I remember it well, I'm not about to forget that day in a hurry. Not after the dreadful time I had.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Well, I was walking down Calabash Road when I slipped on the ice and donked my head! It's always worse after the snow's stopped falling. That's when it's most slippery. Knocked myself clean out, I did. I really thought my number was up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait a minute! Let me get this straight. This happened...on Calabash Road?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">That's right. I live in Cornpipe, you see. Heading down Calabash Road is the quickest way for me to get back from Yore Books.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number six! I must insist... ...that you add that information to your formal statement! It may very well be extremely significant!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry? 'Extremely sick'? No no, I'm quite alright now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I slipped over that evening myself, on Calabash Road. I knocked myself clean out, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that was at around five o'clock, you say? The same time as the victim was attacked.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I don't know anything about the girl who was stabbed. But my dinner's on the table at the same time every day.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And for the record, could you please identify the precise location of your fall?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Goodness, it was aeons ago now. I'm not sure I can remember.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It was three days ago. Try dredging your memory. Please.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm, well, let me see... It was especially slippery around about... Ah yes! I remember now! It was just on the corner here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What happened to you then? Were you alright?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Well, you don't get too many people down Calabash Road, you see. So there was no one around when I fell... No one around when I knocked myself out... No one around when I came to again... And no one around when I sneezed. So I picked myself up and went back to my nice, warm house where my grandchildren were waiting for me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A sad and lonely picture you paint, sir. You were fortunate not to have frozen to death.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, how lucky that he wasn't more seriously injured!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">True. It sounds like it was very nearly another hospital admission...or worse. Ah yes, one more thing... Were you wearing that same green overcoat on the day in question?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Absolutely. It's the only coat I have. It took until this morning to dry out properly. Good job too, or I'd have had nothing to wear here. So count your blessings, I say! Ho ho ho!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, I suppose we should... This gentleman certainly had a close shave there.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, juror number two? Juror number six?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My, whatever do you mean, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">But the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can we really be sure of that, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My! Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was wearing a green overcoat and who fell over on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">My goodness, you, you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Are, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well look at that!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">My goodness me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry? You need a pee?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And crucially! We know precisely where the old man in the green overcoat fell!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">On Calabash Road...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oooh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">And really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">What did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My Lord, I do hope it won't cause any inconvenience, but...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You'd like to change your leaning, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I do declare that I would. I should like to call for a verdict of not guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">And I would too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Is it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do! <thought>Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. On with the summation examination, please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, juror number two? Juror number six?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My, whatever do you mean, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">But the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can we really be sure of that, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My! Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was wearing a green overcoat and who fell over on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">My goodness, you, you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Are, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well look at that!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">My goodness me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry? You need a pee?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And crucially! We know precisely where the old man in the green overcoat fell!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">On Calabash Road...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oooh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">And really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">What did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My Lord, I do hope it won't cause any inconvenience, but...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You'd like to change your leaning, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I do declare that I would. I should like to call for a verdict of not guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">And I would too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Is it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I'm sorry about my overcoat setting a cat among the pigeons. I'm leaning to not guilty to make up for it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It sends a shiver down my spine to hear the members of the jury so convinced of Mr Natsume's guilt. But I can't help feeling that some of their opinions are rather subjective.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I agree. It's the irrelevance of what some of them are saying that sends a shiver down my spine. Still, at least some of their assertions don't actually incriminate Mr Natsume of anything. That's something.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must use that to our advantage, Mr Naruhodo! Cunningly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right. <thought>Let's listen to the jurors again, carefully. And if any of their assertions are at odds, I'll pit them mercilessly against each other.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. Don't hold back. Pit them all against each other!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You've changed two of the jurors' minds, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, just two more to go.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Deliver the finishing blow now! It's time to turn the tables here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Wish I knew how to do a Susato Takedown... I suppose words will have to suffice for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, that summation examination has concluded with a rather large shift in opinion. The ayes, two. The noes, four. So the noes have it. Not guilty, they say. Which means we no longer have a consensus among the members of the jury. The trial will continue!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">L-Lord van Zieks...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It seems I must retract my earlier remark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I mistakenly credited these jurors with intelligence by describing them as 'insightful'. Yet we have just witnessed them falling for a cheap trick performed by an Eastern 'entertainer'.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I haven't tricked anyone! Everything I've said is the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Indeed... Stalwart juror number five was undoubtedly repairing the road, as he claims. I believe you said it was 'a good two yards' of the pavement which you had excavated, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That's right. Took me the whole day and they paid me a measly tuppence for it!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Now, my learned Nipponese friend, tell me... ...do you have any notion of the distance that two yards represents?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Um, well... <thought>If I'm honest, I don't have a clue, no...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Two yards is...a little less than two metres.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Less than two metres? <thought>That's...not much at all!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In other words, a distance readily vaulted by anyone of moderate vigour. ...Would you not agree, my stalwart friend?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? Me? Well, I can't say you're wrong, no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And did you perchance erect a sign to prevent pedestrians from passing the site of your works?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? I wouldn't dream of it! What a waste of time! No coaches would have had a hope of passing anyway, and we just turn any gentlefolk back when they come. Kids just jump right over us all the time.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...The accused is no gentleman, as far as I can see. I have little doubt, however, that he could spring over a two-yard trench in his meanderings around town.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Is that true? Is it?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The incontrovertible truth is that the books just purchased by the accused were found at the scene. There can be no doubt that on his way back to his lodgings, Mr Natsume walked down Briar Road.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>Crushed...in a single sentence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And...old man...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">C-Cold man?! ...You can talk!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You say that around five o'clock on the day in question, you slipped and fell on Calabash Road. Pray, was there a suspicious-looking Nipponese behind you at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh! I, I, um...can't say as I remember.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you don't remember?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">How about a wager, my learned friend? You say it was this old man that the accused saw. But I would lay a thousand to one...against you being able to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Lord van Zieks, explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If you had such a trenchant argument up your sleeve... ...why in the world did you not proffer it during the summation examination?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hmph... I wanted to give this young foreign student the sightseeing experience he no doubt came for. I wanted him to see for himself how the opinion of the jury is so readily swayed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But my hospitality has its limits. And they have been reached, I feel. So, my learned friend...today's sightseeing tour of London is now over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What, what are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord! The prosecution requests permission to call its next witnesses to the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Granted. Bailiff! Bring forth the witnesses!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Its...next witnesses?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, do you not remember? We've been told on several occasions that there were eye witnesses to the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I remember. One of them being a Scotland Yard policeman, no less.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid that's likely to be the prosecution's next witness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright, no matter who van Zieks brings to the stand as his witnesses, and no matter what they say... ...I believe in Soseki-san! I know he's innocent! And I'll keep believing to the very end. Until this battle is over!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah. .........</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">And I'm Mrs. Beate! Patricia's my name. I'm proud to say I'm this young town hero's wife!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...what's the story here?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Well, in truth, we've not been married long. In fact, we celebrated our first anniversary only the other day!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, it was your husband I was asking about. He seems...tired.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hardly surprising. Whilst being an honourable occupation, patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, really? <thought>I'm sure I've heard that before, actually.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed, apart from rare days off, our gallant officers trudge some twenty miles a day, you know. They patrol boarding houses and pubs, collect taxes, survey the streets, check that meters are reading true... And they're responsible for keeping the streets clean, and lighting and extinguishing our streetlights.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There are a number of items on that list that don't sound much like policing duties at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wouldn't just be falling asleep on my feet, I'd have collapsed long ago!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But it goes without saying that a policeman's primary duty is the apprehension of criminals. Even when he's off duty, a constable is expected to investigate and resolve any crimes on his beat. For the London bobby is a man of honour.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And a man of slumber.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On the day in question... ...this man and his wife were walking down Briar Road in the opposite direction. And they witnessed the incident as it occurred. ...Is that not correct, Mr and Mrs Beate?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right, sir! ...Isn't it, Roly?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>What a great witness he's going to be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very good. I'd like to hear your formal testimonies now, please. You will tell the court exactly what you saw on the afternoon of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">It was our wedding anniversary, and Roly was taking me out for a meal. There was no time to change after work.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well...this is extremely compelling testimony, I must say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, this policeman and his wife are claiming to have positively identified Mr Natsume at the scene. If their testimony is true... ...the alternative course of events that you established in the summation examination will be quashed.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Its death knell, in fact. Because that 'alternative' was never viable in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What an unfortunate bechancing. And on your wedding anniversary, too.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, I know! But I still managed to go out for the evening with my man! I thank the Lord for that!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh, the life of a London 'bobby' sounds very hard indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Indeed. However... ...this cross-examination will be over in minutes. You may well have time to rest this afternoon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My learned friend, the witnesses saw the face of the man fleeing the scene. They are testifying under oath that it was without doubt the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And one of these witnesses is a policeman, no less. So you appreciate the gravity of the situation, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Except that the man's so tired, his wife has to do all the talking...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Enough preamble. Counsel for the Defence, commence the cross-examination, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">It was our wedding anniversary, and Roly was taking me out for a meal. There was no time to change after work.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No time to change after work, you say? Are you also a member of the police, Mrs Beate?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh no, sadly not. It's a job for strapping young men only. Women, children and the elderly can't even apply.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I think you can probably see why children and the elderly can't do the job, can't you?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I think Roly looks ever so handsome in his uniform. ...It suits you down the ground, doesn't it, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? Wha...? ...Ah, I'd just finished my beat. Pat and I were heading back to the station. I was actually planning on getting changed there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Is, is he talking in his sleep? This is creepy...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh no, Roly. I much prefer you in uniform. Sometimes I don't recognise you when I see you in plain clothes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, that doesn't seem...healthy.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Kindly adhere to the point. You were going for a meal after you had finished your beat for the day, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">That's right, sah, yes. Although I was fit to drop, to be honest. After spending the whole day on my feet. But policing is my life, sah! As long as I'm the proud owner of this, I'll serve my city and my Queen to the end!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What's that now?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">My warrant card, sah! Proof that I'm a London copper. It has the noble founding principles of the force written on it as a reminder to all us policemen of our sworn duty. To patrol the streets of London town and uphold the peace of the common man... SAH! And for such a noble cause, I cover twenty miles every single day without fail and without a grumble! Because the plodding of my boots is all Londoners need to hear to feel safe and secure!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...fighting crime doesn't appear to come into it, then...</line>
<line speaker="Roly">But SAH! Just on that one particular day, I was looking forward to celebrating my wedding anniversary. Mrs Beate puts up with a lot being married to a bobby like me. I wanted to show my dear wife how much I care!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a charming couple! Their young love is such a joy to behold!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...If a little...over-the-top, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And then...? Kindly describe what happened next.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, Mr Lawyer, sir...can I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...Yes, of course. What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Well, you keep asking us all these questions about everything we've told you, so... ...it seems like you don't believe our testimony! Is that right? Is it? Well? Out with it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! No no no! Oh no, it's really not that at all.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">My husband's a policeman, remember! And I know what I saw! I remember every last detail! Everything! Like, like... Oh, I know! What about the books the man dropped? I could tell you the names of every single one, I could! Every single one! And you dare to question how reliable my testimony is!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That will do, Mrs Beate.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No, it won't do at all! That Japanese lawyer has no idea what I'm capable of! Even if I decide to forgive him for insulting us, don't think for a minute that Roly will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I, I really didn't mean to cause offence. Please, put your husband's fists down.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Per-Perhaps you would like the opportunity to supplement your testimony, Mrs Beate? Might that...appease you?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, thank you, My Lord. That would settle things nicely. Wouldn't it, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Anyway, two silhouettes appeared out of the fog on the pavement in front of us.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two 'silhouettes'?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right. They were coming towards us, walking up Briar Road in the opposite direction. There was a rather plump figure followed by a scrawny, thin-looking man.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That does sound exactly like the victim as pictured in this print. And like Mr Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, unfortunately, it does.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And you're certain that at that time there was nobody else nearby?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh yes, quite certain. It was dark, but there are streetlights on Briar Road, you see. There was nobody else around at all. ...Isn't that right, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? Wha...? ...Ah yes, that's right. Of course, there was a light fog on the ground. But Briar Road is dead straight and you could see a fairly long way down the pavement. And then there's the streetlighting as well. I didn't see any...other...pedestrianzzz...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Before sleep takes a firm hold, your answer, please, Mr Beate. ...Are you quite sure of what you've just said?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, SAH! As a copper who spends all day every day keeping watch on the streets, I'd swear to it, sah! I'm as sure...as my love for Patricia is true!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm... They're still maintaining there was no one else around other than the victim and the attacker. It's starting to seem like that must be how it really happened.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's beginning to seem like there's nowhere to run.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...that didn't stop Mr Natsume, did it? He fled the scene all too convincingly.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you. I believe we have a reasonably clear idea of the situation just before the incident now. What happened in the crucial moments that followed?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">All of a sudden, one of them just collapsed on the floor. Then the other scattered something before running off!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, 'scattered something'...? What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh well, I couldn't quite make out what it was at the time. But then when we got closer, we realised what it was. ...Didn't we, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? Wha...? ...Ah yes, that's right. It was some old books.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see... Old books...</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, SAH! The culprit had dropped a number of them, all around where the victim lay on the pavement.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed, as clearly pictured in this photographic print.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That rotten Japanese man did that when he did the deed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's not forget that it remains to be established that the defendant was indeed the attacker!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">But we saw him! It was the man in the dock without question, sah. The moustache, the hunched back, the cat-like eyes, the taut mouth, the snub nose...everything!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Any more insults you want to throw in?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right! He looked down at that poor, defenceless woman with those terrifying, intense eyes... ...and then suddenly threw his books onto the pavement and ran away!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I see... <thought>This is tough... They seem as though they're telling the truth here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">May I remind the court that this unambiguous testimony comes from a policeman and his wife. Now please...continue.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yeeeeees SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">We ran straight over of course, and then went for help at a nearby police box.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Was it your husband who went to fetch help?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No no, I went. I may not be a police officer myself, but I am the proud wife of one, after all! ...Isn't that right, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? Wha...? Ah, yes. That's right. I asked Mrs Beate to go. I was off duty by that point. But a bobby's never truly off duty, of course, so I felt obliged to stay and guard the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very laudable, Mr Beate. Preserving the scene of a crime is a task of considerable importance.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">That's why I sent Patricia, you see. I told her where to find the right police box.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...forgive my ignorance, but what do you mean exactly by 'the right police box'?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Depends on a crime's location, you see, as to who deals with it. Where the woman was stabbed wasn't actually on my beat. So I told Patricia the way to the police box for the beat the incident fell under so she could go...and report...it.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I ran there as quickly as I could and asked for help from the bobby on duty. There is nothing more potent than a young couple in love working together, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And thanks to your swift response, the case was quickly resolved. The actions...of two model citizens.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh please! You're making us blush! ...Isn't he, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes SAH! What Patricia said, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Let's move on, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, Mr Lawyer, sir...can I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...Yes, of course. What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Well, you keep asking us all these questions about everything we've told you, so... ...it seems like you don't believe our testimony! Is that right? Is it? Well? Out with it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! No no no! Oh no, it's really not that at all.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">My husband's a policeman, remember! And I know what I saw! I remember every last detail! Everything! Like, like... Oh, I know! What about the books the man dropped? I could tell you the names of every single one, I could! Every single one! And you dare to question how reliable my testimony is!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That will do, Mrs Beate.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No, it won't do at all! That Japanese lawyer has no idea what I'm capable of! Even if I decide to forgive him for insulting us, don't think for a minute that Roly will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I, I really didn't mean to cause offence. Please, put your husband's fists down.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Per-Perhaps you would like the opportunity to supplement your testimony, Mrs Beate? Might that...appease you?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, thank you, My Lord. That would settle things nicely. Wouldn't it, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">It was definitely that Japanese man in the dock. Roly and I both saw him as clear as day!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But surely you wouldn't have been able to see his face by the light of the gas streetlamps, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">We absolutely could! Us Londoners have exceptional eyesight, I'll have you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Right.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">The light from the streetlamps was more than enough! And my husband already told you that the fog was only light, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... Yes, and what of the fog?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">We're famous for it across the globe, I believe. But it's an absolute menace to those of us who have to live with it, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, it is, it is. When it's thick, you can't even see the hand at the end of your own arm.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, alright, I take your point. Now...could you stop shaking your husband about?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">The constant fog makes our eyes very sharp, you see. That's why we can tell you for sure and certain that it was that little Japanese man we saw. Can't we darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? Wha...? ...Ah. Yes. It was the accused and no mistake. The moustache, the hunched back, the cat-like eyes, the taut mouth, the snub nozzz... Unmistakable, SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>As far as this couple's testimony is concerned, there can't be any question... It was Soseki-san they saw running away from the scene of the crime.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, Mr Lawyer, sir...can I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...Yes, of course. What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Well, you keep asking us all these questions about everything we've told you, so... ...it seems like you don't believe our testimony! Is that right? Is it? Well? Out with it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! No no no! Oh no, it's really not that at all.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">My husband's a policeman, remember! And I know what I saw! I remember every last detail! Everything! Like, like... Oh, I know! What about the books the man dropped? I could tell you the names of every single one, I could! Every single one! And you dare to question how reliable my testimony is!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That will do, Mrs Beate.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No, it won't do at all! That Japanese lawyer has no idea what I'm capable of! Even if I decide to forgive him for insulting us, don't think for a minute that Roly will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I, I really didn't mean to cause offence. Please, put your husband's fists down.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Per-Perhaps you would like the opportunity to supplement your testimony, Mrs Beate? Might that...appease you?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, thank you, My Lord. That would settle things nicely. Wouldn't it, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I could even tell you the names of the four books he dropped at the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, we know that there were books dropped at the scene of the crime, as you say.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Those purchased by the accused at the nearby secondhand bookshop on the day in question.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">After I'd been to the police box for help, I... Well, I decided to have a good look over the area for good measure. I am a proud policeman's wife, after all! I did it for Roly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...what was your husband doing at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, he was lying face down in the snow. Getting some well-deserved rest. He works ever so hard, you know. Ever so hard! ...Don't you, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Interesting way of guarding the scene of the crime.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mrs Beate, seeing as you've regaled the court with tales of your powers of recollection... ...would you be so kind as to recount the titles of the books you observed at the scene?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I'd be happy to. Now, are you all listening? There was 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'. And...'Whatsit Yearnings'... Then there was, um...'A Meal for...Someone' and the last one was definitely...'The Thingummy's Something'. ...You see?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ...Yes, I see there are one or two holes in your memory.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh well, they were along those lines, I'm quite sure.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There were indeed books found at the scene with titles 'along those lines' as you put it.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Well, what did I tell you? So I think it's very mean the way you've been implying that my testimony can't be trusted. Don't you agree, darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Anyone who upsets my Patricia will have me to answer to! .........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Terrifying.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Yes, she really is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you're saying that there were four books?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right. I remember all of them. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody', 'Whatsit Yearnings', 'A Meal for Someone' and 'The Thingummy's Something'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm sorry, Mrs Beate... ...but there is a fundamental flaw in that statement of yours.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh no! What, what flaw?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Simply that, at the scene of the crime...there were only three books, not four!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the receipt from the bookshop where the defendant bought his books.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">'Yore Books'...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and it details Mr Natsume's purchases that day. But as you can see...only three books are listed.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Only three...? But...no...no, that can't be! I remember seeing them! There were four books, I tell you! Four dirty old books!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh really? Have a good look at this photographic print of the scene of the crime. As you can clearly see from this evidence as well, there are only three books!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">But...I just don't believe it! I saw them there! I swear it! I saw them!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No madam, I'm afraid your powers of observation cannot be relied upon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you're saying that there were four books?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right. I remember all of them. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody', 'Whatsit Yearnings', 'A Meal for Someone' and 'The Thingummy's Something'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm sorry, Mrs Beate... ...but there is a fundamental flaw in that statement of yours.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh no! What, what flaw?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Simply that, at the scene of the crime...there were only three books, not four!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Have a good look at this photographic print of the scene of the crime. As you can clearly see, there are only three books.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">But...no...no, that can't be! I, I saw them! Oh, I know what it is! Yes, you can't fool me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">It's that big old lump of a dead body! The lady's so large, her corpse is blocking the view of the fourth book, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Let's at least try to remember that the poor woman isn't dead, even if we're insulting her size.</thought> No, I'm sorry, Mrs Beate... ...but Mr Natsume could not possibly have dropped the four books you describe!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Fascinating. And from your assured tone, something you can readily substantiate with evidence...I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>...Ah. Evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, you will present evidence to substantiate your claim or withdraw it. What proof do you have that the accused did not drop four books?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Sorry? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No, Counsel, that won't do. Clearly you have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No idea at all! In fact, judging from your vacant expression... ...I'm beginning to question your ability to count higher than the number three.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Argh! <thought>...How could he possibly say that?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I feel sure that we know this already. The number of books Mr Natsume was carrying that day, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I think I'd better look over the evidence again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The evidence is right here...in the form of this bookshop receipt!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">From Yore Books?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, this receipt details Mr Natsume's purchases that day. But as you can see...only three books are listed.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore Mr Natsume would have only dropped three books at the scene of the crime. Which means that your powers of observation, madam, cannot be relied upon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So that's it, is it? That's their entire testimony?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I hate to admit it, but on hearing the testimony... ...it really does seem as though Mr and Mrs Beate saw what they say they saw. Mr Natsume running away from the scene on Briar Road that day.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Yes, I feel the same.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So if that's true, where does it leave us?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The members of the jury are sure to call for a guilty verdict after this testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no! <thought>Then what do we do?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... If Kazuma-sama were here...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think he would try to find a contradiction somewhere else within their testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, 'somewhere else'?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Their statement about seeing Mr Natsume is unequivocal. Calling that into question won't help. But if you could identify some other part of their testimony which appears to contradict the facts... ...you might be able to discredit them! To make the jury doubt if the pair's memory of the day is accurate!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...right...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Put simply, we must focus on finding a discrepancy in these statements somewhere. If we don't, I'm afraid the trial may reach an early and unfavourable conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>Why do I always seem to be so up against it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So it cannot be denied... ...that though you say it was the defendant that you saw... ...you could very well be mistaken!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh no... Oh no, oh no, oh no... NOOOOOOOOO!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What cannot be denied is that these two witnesses saw the accused running from the scene. A fact that you know very well you have no hope of disproving.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So you've striven to avert attention from that by dint of some inconsequential discrepancies. Would that be...fair?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Ugh. <thought>He sees right through me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But your plan has somewhat recoiled against you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It's quite simple. Let me explain with a toast. To the policeman's wife, and her entirely accurate testimony. ...In every respect.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You see, the matter is not up for debate. At the scene on Briar Road, a total of four books were most definitely found.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but what about the photographic print? It only shows three books!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Quite right. Only three can be seen...in that print.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That print? You, you mean to say...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to present another! ...One that shows the victim's hand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As you will observe... ...the fourth book was hidden from view in the original print by the victim's torso.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No... NOOOOOOOOO!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">There! You see? You see?! Look at that! Look, look, look!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">It's just like I said! ...Isn't it, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, SAH! Patricia's always right, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let us study the receipt for the books purchased by the accused on the day in question. Mrs Beate, the titles once again, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh yes, of course. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...'The Picture of Monsieur Lecoq'.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">'Whatsit Yearnings'...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...'Canterbury Yearnings'.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">'A Meal for Someone'...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...'A Meal for Gaboriau', in fact. As the court has just heard, the witness remembers the book titles flawlessly, save for a few minor details. Mrs Beate's powers of recollection can only be described as exceptional.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Did you hear that, Roly? The gentleman paid me a compliment!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes SAH! Flawless, sah! Patricia is flawless!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">B-But...there are only three books on the receipt. And Mrs Beate mentioned four.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There's nothing surprising about that. Clearly the fourth book is that which is shown in this photographic print.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Counsel, but does that not seem odd? Why should the fourth book be omitted from the receipt?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It's not odd at all, My Lord. As the photograph clearly shows, the fourth book was found in the victim's clutches. In other words...it belongs to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>The victim...was holding her own book?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder...what became of that fourth book?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Obviously, it wasn't overlooked by the investigating officers at Scotland Yard. I have it here, as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will submit that and the aforementioned photographic print to the court, please, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...My pleasure, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution rests. I have nothing further to add.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let me see... It's a book entitled 'The Lion's Pride'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid I don't know any English literature at all. So it wouldn't be something I've heard- Wait a minute! 'The Lion's Pride'? <thought>That's strange... ...I think I have heard of a book by that name before. And very recently, too.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's a title I recognise too, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Look at this! The book has been badly burnt!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're right. You'd never be able to read it in this state. Especially not the latter pages.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What a terrible waste... Judging from the scorched edges of the paper, I think the damage must have occurred very recently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm...a book...recently damaged by fire... <thought>Why does that seem to raise a red flag with me?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I keep looking at this book, and every time I can't believe how badly burnt it is.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And I can't believe what a terrible waste it is. The more I look at the damage... ...the more I'm sure it must have happened very recently, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A book damaged by fire very recently... <thought>Why does that seem significant somehow?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You seem surprised, my learned friend. But your resistance until now has been in vain. Entertaining, yes. But futile. The spurious longer route to the accused's lodgings that you tried to establish in your summation examination... ...and the attempted discrediting of the witness's powers of recollection in your cross-examination...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Futile...? <thought>...I walked right into this, didn't I?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">You see? Everything we've said is true! ...Isn't that right, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, Pat! Marry me, Pat!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...So, perhaps the ladies and gentlemen of the jury would like to reconsider their positions? Should the court waste any more time on this Nipponese travesty? ...Or is the decision you have to make all too apparent already?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You have heard all of the witnesses and seen all of the evidence. This trial has run its course!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! I'm afraid we are in a terribly precarious position!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know! But... ...if I fight back in the wrong way now, I could very well just make matters worse! <thought>Think, Ryunosuke, think! What do you do now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm, I'm not done yet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I should just keep quiet now and see what happens.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it appears the defence has no objection at this juncture. In which case...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! Was I not clear? The case for the defence is in great danger!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I realise that. Which is why I decided to let the sweat drip from my trembling brow in silence.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You're so right! Sorry! If I don't say anything now, it'll all be over! <thought>And it won't end well for us. I can't let that happen!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! Wait! The, the defence-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! <thought>...Isn't your derisive finger-pointing punishment enough?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No, my learned friend. It's over. That last cross-examination was your final chance to establish a credible defence. And you failed. The die has been cast. There is no more room for debate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...it might be over as far as you're concerned, but... but... ......... <thought>Argh! I can't think of what to say!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... ...If I may, Lord van Zieks? It seems somewhat boorish to close down the debate at this point.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hmph. Your insignificant little Eastern isle must be a lawless hole indeed. For a lowly judicial assistant to have the audacity to intervene at a moment like this...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I am, to my shame, still a very inexperienced lawyer. So you will have to forgive me, but I consider my assistant's advice essential and her opinions invaluable.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... One of this land's great guiding principles is tolerance. So...the court will hear you, madam.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Go ahead, Miss Susato. ...Please.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Very well... Pray, what insight can you give us? What have we all overlooked in this matter that you see fit to pursue further?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Well, the court has been presented with new evidence, but...only after the last cross-examination finished.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. And you believe that this new evidence warrants further examination, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um...Mr Naruhodo? What do you think? It's just possible that this new evidence might be the decisive proof we've been waiting for. The judge is sure to ask the members of the jury to announce their leanings in a moment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And of course, he's sure to ask you to explain what the crucial piece of evidence is and why. So we must take this opportunity to examine the newly presented evidence as thoroughly as possible!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I understand. And...thank you, Miss Susato! <thought>This is it. Susato-san has managed to win us one last chance here... I can't let it go to waste!</thought> The defence wishes to present evidence, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well. The defence may present one further piece of evidence. Evidence that has apparently offers a profound insight into this case, and has hitherto been overlooked.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You have already had ample opportunity to discuss that evidence. If you disagree... ...feel free to conduct further examination at your own leisure...without wasting any more of the court's time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Don't forget that the prosecution presented some new evidence at the end of the last cross-examination. I suspect that might be where the clue we're looking for lies.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In the new evidence? <thought>...What was that again?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Remember that the judge is sure to ask you to explain what significance the evidence has as well. So we should take a moment to examine the evidence in the Court Record as thoroughly as possible!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The evidence in question is what we can see from the newly presented photographic print of the crime scene. The fourth book, found in the victim's hand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... Yes, I'm afraid, Counsel, I must concur with the prosecution on this matter. When I afforded you this opportunity... ...you led the court to believe that the evidence in question contained a hitherto undiscovered clue.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So I must insist that you elaborate, Counsel. You will identify this clue at once. ...Do I make myself clear?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Um...yes! My Lord! It's...erm...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...I believe the prosecution is trying to avoid a thorough examination of the evidence. Which means...you may very well be on the right track!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I... Yes! I think you might be right!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, Counsel... ...precisely where is the vital clue to this case, which this fourth book conceals?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's been badly damaged by fire here. So much so that you couldn't read it all any more.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. ...Such a pity. And do you see the flaking edges of the burnt pages, Mr Naruhodo? I think that's a sure sign that the damage occurred relatively recently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, a book damaged in a recent fire... <thought>That definitely rings a bell...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You may nod knowingly, Counsel, but I'm afraid it shan't further your cause.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your answer, my learned friend... ...is meaningless. Even to yourself, I suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...you...do realise that you can turn the evidence around and look it from all angles, I suppose?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of, of course I do! This isn't the first time I've done this.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm just surprised that you could overlook something so obviously out of the ordinary. I...I suppose it's your... Yes! Your magnanimous nature!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...She took her time picking that word, didn't she? Perhaps I should take another look at the evidence. In a little more detail this time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I would ask the court to observe the back of the book in question.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The back? What do you- Good gracious! It's been burnt to a crisp!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So we have to ask ourselves, why was the victim clutching what is clearly an unreadable book? It is undeniably...an extremely unnatural thing for her to have been doing.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Were I to concede the point, if it bears no relation to the case, there is nothing to discuss. So, should you wish to assert that this fire damage is some veiled clue as to what happened that day... ...pray, do enlighten us all. What truth does this charred book hide?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>A charred book... There is just one possibility here, which I can't quite bring myself to rule out. It's an outside chance certainly, but worth a try...</thought> Alright. I'll explain my theory.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Don't keep us waiting any longer then, Counsel. Explain this theory of yours. What are you suggesting that you can ascertain from the fire damage this sorry tome has suffered?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, the burn on the back of this book reveals a startling truth... ...about the shop from which it was purchased!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What on earth do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">To have sold a half-burnt and unreadable book such as this, we can be quite sure... ...that the establishment it came from is a terrible bookshop!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's, that's right! A terrible one!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...A valid conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Oh good, everyone seems to agree. Maybe I'm onto something here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If I may, Mr Naruhodo... ...I most certainly cannot agree.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No. You're right. <thought>A copy of 'The Lion's Pride' that's just recently suffered damage from a fire... Why do I feel as though I know about this book already from somewhere?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, the burn on the back of this book reveals a startling truth... ...about the book's content!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What on earth do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">To have enraged its reader to the point of burning it, we can be quite sure... ...that this book is a dreadful read!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's, that's right! A dreadful read!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...A valid conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Oh good, everyone seems to agree. Maybe I'm onto something here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If I may, Mr Naruhodo... ...I most certainly cannot agree.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No. You're right. <thought>A copy of 'The Lion's Pride' that's just recently suffered damage from a fire... Why do I feel as though I know about this book already from somewhere?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, the burn on the back of this book reveals a startling truth... ...about the book's owner.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">But...we already know who the book belongs to! The victim was gripping it in her hand as she fell to the floor, after all. It's obviously hers!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The question of how this book came to be in the victim's hand has yet to be answered. However... ...as to the questions of who the book really belongs to, and where it originated... ...the defence...has very credible answers!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! How can you possibly...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Very well. I'll play along with this futile attempt to delay your inevitable demise. But do remember, the members of the jury may well burn you if your little gamble goes awry.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, the defence's response here is very likely to influence the final outcome of this trial. So tell the court...who do you claim is the owner of this burnt book?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's...something of a gut feeling, My Lord, but... ...I can think of no one else more likely to set a book on fire!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What kind of morbid reasoning is that?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. It would appear the smoke from the flames has clouded your judgement, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAARGH! <thought>Never fight fire with fire...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">A burnt copy of a book entitled 'The Lion's Pride'... I'm quite sure that this isn't the first time we've heard about it, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No, it isn't, is it? Of course!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The answer...is that the book belongs to the couple who own the house where the defendant has his lodgings... ...a certain Mr and Mrs Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The landlords?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And whether this is some extraordinary coincidence, of some kind of fate at work, I don't know, but... ...of all the people in London, one of the six chosen for jury duty in this courtroom today... ...is none other than Mrs Garrideb herself!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, oh my goodness...ME?! I, I think you must be mistaken, sir. I'm...I'm... I'm not Mr Garrideb's wife! I'm...his...maid!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Things would be so much easier if you would just drop the pretence. Alright then, how about a simple question for you? Have you ever seen this book in Mr Garrideb's house?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I, I would never presume to know all of the books he keeps, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is not mere conjecture. The defence happens to know... ...that on the day in question... ...at almost exactly the same time as the victim was stabbed on the pavement below... ...another 'incident' was taking place in the room on the top floor of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! What sort of incident, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...A fire, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. Didn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...'The Lion's Pride'...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By Jove! The very same title that's the subject of this debate!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh dear me!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps it would make more sense...if I told you that the cause of the fire was...marital discord. Without going into details, it appears that Mrs Garrideb was considerably enraged. Apparently she continued to attack Mr Garrideb even amid the flames.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, how awful! I can't even imagine being so horrid to the one you love. ...Can you, Roly?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Absolutely not, SAH! My Patricia would never raise a finger against me, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Had all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke! Then the wife started hurling things at me. There was I, back up against the window, under heavy enemy fire! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The man had his back up against the window...and he had burning books thrown at him? Goodness gracious! Are, are you suggesting... ...that the book was thrown through a window and...and landed coincidentally at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's quite true. We also saw no sign of broken glass when we visited the Garrideb household. But is it not conceivable that the window was open at the time in-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Not even remotely! Let us not forget the season, and the chilling weather that accompanies it. No Londoner would ever leave a window open in the middle of winter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... Does the defence postulate this scenario in all seriousness, Counsel? Do you earnestly claim that the book found at the scene was a flaming projectile thrown by Mr Garrideb's wife?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I believe it's a possibility, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well! I hope that everyone can see you for what you are now, you little foreign trickster! You call yourself a lawyer, but you're just a coward! A mean coward!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Really?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Claiming that our little tiff set the whole neighbourhood alight... Honestly! Implying that I'm merely posing as a maid for appearances' sake... How could you?! It's nothing to do with this beastly case, not any of it! All you've done is sully our family's name!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! I, I assure you, that was never my intention!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Dragging an upstanding citizen's name through the mud simply to divert attention from your failing defence... I should box your ears, that's what I should do! It's utterly unforgivable!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Too right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Here we go...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">How long have we sat here now, listening to this Nipponese spouting out his fancy foreign theories? But...think about it! At the end of the day, the only person who could possibly have stabbed the victim... ...is that little hunchback with the moustache! And he ran away from the scene, too!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I, I do declare you're right...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">It's true!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Yes! What did I tell you?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Makes sense to me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Hm? Sorry? What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well... ...it would appear that the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are once again in full agreement. What is your position, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In truth, My Lord...I feel these have been unnecessarily protracted proceedings. But then one must always exercise patience in order to savour the best vintage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! Wait! The, the mystery of the fourth book still hasn't been-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If books are your predilection, my learned friend...study them on your own time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...What, no 'forgive the discourtesy' this time?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ahem! In that case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will now state your individual decisions regarding the defendant's culpability for the court to hear!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Thank you...for that unambiguous response.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's twice now. It's over...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Mr Naruhodo, don't give up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Miss Susato...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you forgotten? The battle isn't over yet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're, you're not suggesting...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Of course. The defence has the right to another summation examination at this point. You could still convince the jurors to change their minds. You have one more chance!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...My Lord! The defence...asks to exercise its right to a summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hmph. You believe you still have tricks up your sleeve?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't intend to trick anybody. I intend to uncover the truth! <thought>This is no time to be downcast. As long as there's a chance, I have to stay strong and determined!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">I have considered the defence counsel's request for a further summation examination of the jury... ...and I have determined that the court must uphold the defence's judicial right to this procedure. So, Counsel...you will now proceed with your second summation examination. I presume the jury is ready, Mr Foreman?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">We are, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very good. In that case, I must ask each of you now to state clearly and concisely for the court... ...the grounds on which you find the defendant guilty of this crime.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">The accused left behind evidence at the scene, didn't he? Those three books of his.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If there was some novel alternative explanation about how the victim was stabbed, I might reconsider...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Even if the woman was throwing books, it can't be related to this crime if the window was closed, can it?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Dearie me, it was only a little book! Hardly life-threatening, even with a direct hit!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Look, I just want to get this over with. If I don't bring home some pay tonight, I'll be in a tidy bit of trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Come to think of it, we had a fire at home a while ago. It gave me the sneezes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, yes...considerably more tangible arguments from all members of the jury this time around, it seems. ...With one notable exception, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My learned student friend was unable to find fault in the previous witness testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So the court must accept the fact that it was indeed the accused seen fleeing from the scene. And moreover... ...no one else was even at the scene to commit the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, if the eye witnesses are correct...it would seem as if the conclusion is somewhat set in stone. I fail to see how it can be argued any other way.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...That means, I'm afraid, that during this summation examination... ...it's essential that you establish some other tangible explanation for the facts!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But how? What would even constitute a tangible explanation here?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Isn't it obvious? Who stabbed the woman and how? Those two details are all you need provide. Simply give us a name and a method by which the attack was conducted.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...And there I was thinking this might be hard.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">But Mr Naruhodo, you have to do it! Otherwise this really will be where the trial ends!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, no pressure then...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's quite enough preamble. Proceed with the summation examination, please. I presume you are prepared, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, yes! ...My Lord. <thought>Alright, Ryunosuke, focus your mind now... Clearly, the key to this summation examination... ...is going to be juror number four, the maid. Or should I say, Mrs Garrideb?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We have a book that disappeared from the Garridebs' house on the evening of the incident... ...and the fourth book found in the victim's hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There must be a way to link the two. Yes, that's what we have to find... <thought>...using every technique I've learnt in my short career so far! Whatever it takes!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't forget to keep an eye on Mrs Garrideb and how she reacts...even to the things other people say!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">The accused left behind evidence at the scene, didn't he? Those three books of his.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But as we now know, there were four books, not three!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Well? What difference does it make?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's every possibility that the fourth book...in fact belongs to the defendant's landlord!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yes, that's the part I have a problem with.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Well, at the point the woman was stabbed, this landlord fellow was at home, wasn't he? Enjoying a fiery scrap with his wife or something, you said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's not exactly how I put it, no.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Well anyway, the point is, the fellow and his wife were somewhere else when it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think...that's what you call a strong alibi.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">So it couldn't have been the landlord who did it. Which only leaves the Nipponese fellow. Honestly, I can't see what all this palaver's about. It's a done deal, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...I suppose it is, since I've nothing witty left to say.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If there was some novel alternative explanation about how the victim was stabbed, I might reconsider...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you might be willing to change your decision, you mean?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my! Such delight on your face! But I'm afraid I shan't be swayed by emotion. Despite what you may think of me, I am a very modern, metropolitan and rational woman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's great.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If one reads the morning papers, it's all forgotten by tea time, isn't it? So why read them in the first place? You see? Modern, metropolitan and rational thinking, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And not at all extreme.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No, 2">As I see it, an overwhelmingly suspicious Japanese man has been implicated by overwhelmingly strong testimony. So despite one or two minor puzzlements, I do declare that the man is overwhelmingly guilty! ...Modern, metropolitan and rational logic, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Overwhelmingly.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">But us modern 'gals' are always delighted to embrace new fads, you know. So I'd be only too happy to consider an exciting new theory if you could come up with one!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I'd be happy to do that, too...if only I could.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's do our very best not to disappoint the modern and metropolitan young lady!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Right. <thought>I'm glad you omitted 'rational' there.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Even if the woman was throwing books, it can't be related to this crime if the window was closed, can it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But what about the possibility that the window was open?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What about it? I mean, there's just no way it could have been.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you be so sure?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">The prosecutor fellow over there said it earlier, didn't he? Winters in London are no joke. You don't want to invite that sort of cold indoors. So no, that window wasn't open. Us Londoners like sitting by the fire and staying warm, see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But you couldn't categorically state that the window wasn't open, could you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">It just wasn't. They wouldn't have opened it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then what's the point in even having windows? Huh?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel! You will kindly refrain from childish bickering!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um...sorry... <thought>Somehow, I need to show there's an undeniable possibility that the window was open... ...because this young man isn't going to budge otherwise.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These two jurors' statements clearly contradict one another!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They do? How exactly, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Don't point at me again! I told you, it wasn't me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? What's that you say? Speak up, lad, speak up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number three! Do you see?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh! Me? See, see what, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you hear juror number six's account of his birthday celebrations last year? It seems, despite being a Londoner, he once opened his windows in the middle of winter.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well yes, of course. Because it was an emergency. I mean, obviously, if the room was filled with smoke from a fire, then you'd be mad not...to open the... ......... Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. On the day in question, at the time of the incident, there was a fire in the Garrideb household. And Mr Garrideb had the following to say about it: 'The whole place filled with smoke.'</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">On my hat!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number four! Do you have something to say about that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wh-What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The room would have been thick with smoke after the carpet and bookcase caught fire as they did. In a situation like that...it's inconceivable that you wouldn't have opened the window!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... And what if we did?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Even though your house was on fire?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Of course. I should have realised.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that the window was open. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore, to clear the smoke, either Mr Garrideb or his wife almost certainly opened the window. That, you cannot deny, would be in no way out of the ordinary!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">No...I suppose it wouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">When you get to my age, you learn a thing or two, you know. And I can tell you... ...you'd have to be a prize idiot not to open the window if there was a fire! Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes! Of course! I, I think I need to reconsider my statement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! Please do. <thought>That's a step in the right direction...I think.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">The window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">At the point when the victim was attacked on Briar Road... ...we know there was a small house fire in the Garrideb household on the opposite side of the street.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well yes, it certainly seems that way. And on account of the smoke, I imagine they would have had the windows wide open in spite of the cold.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number four! Do you have something to say about that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wh-What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The room would have been thick with smoke after the carpet and bookcase caught fire as they did. In a situation like that...it's inconceivable that you wouldn't have opened the window!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... And what if we did?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Even though your house was on fire?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Of course. I should have realised.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that the window was open. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We also know that Mrs Garrideb was throwing flaming books at her husband. Her husband, who was backed into a corner by the window due to his wife's frenzied attack.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes, that's right. So there's definitely a chance that one of the books could have flown past the man and out of the window. Only...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Only what?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Only I can't really see how it could have gone all the way over to the other side of the road, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">So I don't really see how I can change my decision, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...I see... <thought>...That wasn't enough? What is it going to take to persuade these people?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Dearie me, it was only a little book! Hardly life-threatening, even with a direct hit!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the 'little book' was on fire at the time, was it not?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...With flames of love, I'll have you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...There's really no such thing as a 'loving' incendiary bomb.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well he brought it upon himself! It's playing with fire to betray a fiery love! Isn't it? ...Well? Don't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Erm...well...any kind of betrayal is...is certainly a bad thing, yes. But I think the argument might have arisen out of your misunderstanding, Mrs Garrideb...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Never you mind that! The point is, we were just having a jovial little dispute, nothing more! And I won't have any more of these suggestions that it was anything whatsoever to do with this crime!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Right, well, we'll see about that. But what about juror number five? He doesn't seem to be turning a hair at Mrs Garrideb's relentless onslaughts...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's almost as though he's used to it. What a gentle soul he is!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Now you mention it, yes, the window was open at the time. I'd clean forgotten, but it's true.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The fourth book found at the scene of the crime shows very obvious signs of fire damage. And the title of the book...is 'The Lion's Pride'. The same title, in fact, as the book that Mr Garrideb told us he had been reading.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... Well, I really couldn't say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the day in question, did you or did you not throw at your husband... ...the copy of 'The Lion's Pride' that he had been reading?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... I did.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">It was the first thing I could lay my hands on. So I hurled it straight at him! And now you come to mention it, yes... ...he was rather enjoying reading it, you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why did you not reveal this information to the court from the outset?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Because I couldn't, you insolent little man! I didn't remember! At times like that, you pick up and throw whatever you can lay your hands on, as well you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I really don't.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I barely noticed I was throwing a book, much less the title of it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, juror number five?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">......... You know something? I've, I've remembered what it was! That memory I'd blocked out...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">It was listening to what this granny was saying. Brought it all flooding back.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Who are you calling a granny, you cheeky devil?! I'm Mrs Garrideb or the maid, I'll have you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...The man doesn't even flinch. Please tell me that's not because he's so used to being hit all the time!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">It, it was about two weeks ago now. I'd just got back home after work, like. I put my hand in my pocket for the wages I'd just earnt that day...and I nearly died. There was a hole. Every last penny had dropped out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh dear, what a disaster.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You haven't heard the half of it, boy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">The wife was cutting up some chicken at the time. I, I could hardly get the words out, but I told her straight: 'I've lost the day's wages, luv.' Next thing I knew, the blade was whistling past my ear. Stuck into the wall next to me, it did. About an inch deep.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>No words... Just...terror...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I could smell it then, you know. That God-awful stench of the Thames. I was sure I was going to end up face down in the muddy banks that night, I can tell you. Now...that's a real disaster, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'll never use the word lightly again.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is this: When women lose their rag, they'll throw anything at you! Knives, hatchets, hammers...you name it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! You mustn't think that all women are so short-tempered and unrefined!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, I wasn't thinking that!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Throwing household objects at people is... Well, it's so uncivilised. At least attack with honour! Using a bow or the like.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Attack? ...Who are you going to attack?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Never mind. Anyway, this man's words... ...could be rather significant, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright, we'll come back to the bow and arrow thing later...if I dare.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Right. Totally understandable.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I mean, you can't waste time deciding what to use next, can you? When you feel the way I did...you don't care what it is, you just want it to smash into his face!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... You see where violence can lead, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'm disheartened to think you might believe me capable of such behaviour. Anyway... I have a feeling I might have noticed someone reacting a little strangely to Mrs Garrideb's remarks just now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ah, perhaps I missed something while I was... preoccupied...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Look, I just want to get this over with. If I don't bring home some pay tonight, I'll be in a tidy bit of trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You just want to 'get this over with'? How can you sit there and say something like that? A man's future is at stake here!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Well him and me both then, like I said before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I told you already. I'm a day labourer, aren't I? If I don't bring home some readies with me tonight... ...you'll find me floating face down in the Thames tomorrow morning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You heard me! My missus isn't one to mess about, you know. She can be fierce, believe you me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Another shining example of marital bliss, then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">A situation like this cropped up the other day. It was...well...um... ......... D'you know, it's funny, but I can't quite remember.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">It was too frightening, that's the thing. I must have blocked it out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Helpful...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder if Mr Beate will ever be dragged into the Thames by his scarf...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Don't even go there, Miss Susato. <thought>There must be some way to jog his memory about this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">A woman in a rage will hurl almost anything at you. The kitchen knife really brought that home to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your wife really threw a kitchen knife at you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That's right. She was chopping meat with it. ...Had a tidy edge on it, believe me. Still...it's all memories, isn't it? It started with that smile  she threw me when we were courting. And since then, the list of things she's thrown at me has grown along with our relationship. There was a cup, then a glass...then a pot...a kettle...a chair...a wardrobe...a cooker...a bathtub...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Your wife must be even beefier than you.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">And things came to a head last week when she threw me. Right into the Thames. Still...she's not so bad when she's calmed down. She's a little sweetheart, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm...so happy for you.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">If you want to know what I think... ...I think this whole idea of 'ladies first' that we're so obsessed with in this country... ...was thought up by some clever lads who'd been tossed in the Thames a few too many times by their wives.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... That's...a very interesting theory.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What a terrible thought.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>On the face of it... ...this juror's statement just sounds like a really extreme anecdote. But I think it might turn out to be an extremely powerful weapon. A weapon I might be able to use to make the jurors accept an alternative explanation here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Come to think of it, we had a fire at home a while ago. It gave me the sneezes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Does...that have anything to do with your decision about the defendant's culpability in this case?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Sorry? What's that? You'll have to speak up, lad.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Could you tell us more about that fire?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">It was last winter. My grandchildren baked me a lovely cake on my birthday. It had seventy-five candles on the top, it did! What a sight to behold it was!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You put candles...on a cake?! Was, was it some kind of devil-worship?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Of course not! It was an angel cake! To celebrate my birthday, obviously!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It seems that's a common custom here in Great Britain, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Anyway, I mustered all my puff to blow them out... ...only I must have blown wrong somehow. The flames didn't go out, but candles went flying all over the room! The furniture caught and everything went up! The whole place filled with smoke!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Definitely sounds like devil-worship to me.</thought> And...by 'the sneezes', I presume you mean a cold. But how did you catch a cold from a fire?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">What a fiasco it was. The grandchildren, bless them, threw water over me as they tried to put out the flames. And then, because the whole room had filled up with smoke of course... ...we had to open all the windows to clear it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The windows...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The biting winter air rushed over me like the devil dancing on my grave, it did! I caught a terrible cold from it. It put me in hospital for a while. ...I won't forget that birthday in a hurry!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I knew it was devil-worship all along. <thought>But something about this old man's story is playing on my mind for some reason...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Winter house fires are dire. You have to open windows to clear the smoke. That's when the chill gets you, see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Um, did you change your statement from before?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Well, yes. It was one of my most memorable birthdays, you see. I couldn't let it go unremembered.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...I'm sure the defendant will be delighted that you're using his trial to explore your past.</thought> And how is that memory related to this case exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry? What's that? You'll have to speak up, I'm afraid!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Never mind. <thought>He's as deaf as a post...when he wants to be. ...But actually, this old man's anecdote... ...might just provide the alternative explanation I need to make my point to some of the other jurors.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">We used unlit candles on my birthday this year. It's safer that way.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These two jurors' statements clearly contradict one another!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They do? How exactly, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Don't point at me again! I told you, it wasn't me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? What's that you say? Speak up, lad, speak up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number three! Do you see?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh! Me? See, see what, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you hear juror number six's account of his birthday celebrations last year? It seems, despite being a Londoner, he once opened his windows in the middle of winter.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well yes, of course. Because it was an emergency. I mean, obviously, if the room was filled with smoke from a fire, then you'd be mad not...to open the... ......... Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. On the day in question, at the time of the incident, there was a fire in the Garrideb household. And Mr Garrideb had the following to say about it: 'The whole place filled with smoke.'</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">On my hat!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number four! Do you have something to say about that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wh-What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The room would have been thick with smoke after the carpet and bookcase caught fire as they did. In a situation like that...it's inconceivable that you wouldn't have opened the window!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... And what if we did?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Even though your house was on fire?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Of course. I should have realised.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that the window was open. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore, to clear the smoke, either Mr Garrideb or his wife almost certainly opened the window. That, you cannot deny, would be in no way out of the ordinary!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">No...I suppose it wouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">When you get to my age, you learn a thing or two, you know. And I can tell you... ...you'd have to be a prize idiot not to open the window if there was a fire! Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes! Of course! I, I think I need to reconsider my statement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! Please do. <thought>That's a step in the right direction...I think.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We need to demonstrate who, apart from Mr Natsume, could have attacked the young woman on the street. As well as how he...or she could have done it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but once again the jurors' statements are full of personal prejudice. A lot of them seem convinced they're right, even in the face of logical arguments to the contrary.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think you're going to need to pit them against each other to force them to accept an alternative explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... <thought>I don't necessarily need to find contradictions between their assertions... Just a connection might do the trick.</thought> Alright, I'll see what I can do. If anything stands out, I'll go in for a strike!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's the spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm... When you were discussing the window before... ...I feel sure a certain member of the jury reacted in a rather unusual way.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I thought I might have seen something like that out of the corner of my eye. It could be worth pursuing...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! 'Pursue' jurors to catch them off guard, that's the secret!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>We need to use every trick at our disposal here, so...let's see what I can do!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the window was open when the Garridebs were arguing that day.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, Mrs Garrideb has finally admitted to it. Which is a very significant victory for the defense!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...I feel like the fog's starting to clear, and an alternative explanation to this case is starting to show itself.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These two statements clearly have a deeply significant connection!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! You mean they don't contradict each other? Explain, Counsel! At once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number two...do you think perhaps... ...that this could be one such novel alternative?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my! Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An alternative explanation...as to how the victim was stabbed in the back.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've demonstrated that the fourth book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that was found at the scene of the crime... ...originated in Mr Garrideb's room on the top floor of his house. Therefore it's equally possible that some other object besides the book... ...could have found its way from the Garrideb household to the street below.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? What's that now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">After all, Mrs Garrideb could have thrown any number of different objects at her husband. ...Isn't that right, juror number four?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">What are you insinuating now, you...you little beanpole?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I'm beginning to think that...ever since the true origins of this book came to light... ...perhaps she's had a feeling this might be what happened.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now you listen here, you Eastern galah! As the foreman of this jury, I demand a straight answer. You give us this yarn about some other object making its way out of the house...but what? What was it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I'm really taking a big gamble here. That was a bold accusation to make...but I haven't any real evidence to back it up. But I'm certain...that at the very least this warrants further investigation.</thought> Alright, Mr Foreman, I'll try to explain the defence's theory. The 'other object' that found its way from the Garrideb household to the scene of the crime was...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">......... Did you hear that, everyone? Did you hear that belligerent outburst?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my! How horrifying!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...I think it's very clear now. You're the one grasping at the first thing that comes to hand here, young man!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, be careful! It's very dangerous to give indiscriminate answers like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, I'm sorry. I was nervous and I obviously went for the wrong thing. <thought>After all, what I'm suggesting here is a long shot, to put it mildly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Juror number four...Mrs Garrideb...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Wha...? What now?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I must apologise in advance for this... ...but I need you to confirm something else for the court. This knife... Have you ever seen this knife before?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord, Counsel! What on earth are you doing? That's the weapon that was lodged into the victim's back, man!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, remember that when the victim was attacked, Mr and Mrs Garrideb were in the throes of an argument. Mrs Garrideb was hurling anything she could at her husband, who'd been backed up against the window. A window that had been opened to clear the smoke...and through which a book sailed to land at the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">You can't seriously believe that! The book...was found in the victim's grasp!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Are you saying that it flew out of the window and across the street to land neatly in her hand?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Huh! Even my missus hasn't got an aim like that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I admit...there are many details we don't yet understand. But that's the point! That's precisely why... ...we must not allow this trial to end! Not right now!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Garrideb, your answer, please! Have you seen this knife before or not?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... ...Oh! Ah...um... AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I, I wish to change my decision! ...I'm a woman of my word, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you, madam!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yes, I agree. I certainly didn't see this coming, but... ...I just don't think it would be right for this trial to come to an end now with so many unanswered questions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Foreman!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">......... I'd have to agree. Not that I think the granny did it, mind.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...Yes, you know what? I'm not quite happy about this at the moment, either.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">All together now, ladies and gents...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We... We...did it...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, as a result of the defence's summation examination, a number of jurors' leanings have changed. Two jurors call guilty, against four now calling innocent. Accordingly, the opinion of this court is divided... ...and this trial will continue!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, Lord van Zieks...how does the prosecution wish to proceed?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...This trial is rapidly descending into a farce. Like a corked wine...the first few sips are bitter enough... ...but what follows is so repugnant, it's good for nothing save the gutter!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">If, if I may, Lord van Zieks... ...the defence has just put forward a credible alternative explanation for what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Credible? Is that your considered opinion, Mr Foreman? The defence's argument is a joke to which I barely know how to respond. But let me start by insisting... ...that you must familiarise yourselves better with the relative positions of those places being discussed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean by that? <thought>...What's his angle this time?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It should already be more than apparent, that between the crime scene and the Garrideb household... ...runs a rather wide street, Briar Road. Which means that the distance from the Garridebs' house to the scene is some... Yes, fifteen yards.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let me see... Fifteen yards... That's around fourteen metres.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">F-Fourteen metres? <thought>Oh. ...That's a little farther than I'd imagined.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And, as you ladies and gentlemen of the jury rightly noted as having portentous significance... ...the fourth book was found in the victim's clutches. In other words...the smouldering book, wantonly hurled by the lady of the house travelled some fifteen yards... ...to land on the opposite side of the road, neatly between the collapsed victim's fingers and thumb. ...Is that your final conclusion, my learned...and deluded friend?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Um...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And did the jackknife follow a near identical trajectory to plunge into the middle of the victim's back? This fantasy is somewhat stretching the notion of 'having a bad day' for the victim, I think. Even those pathetic serialised detective stories have more believable plots!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... <thought>There's nothing I can say to that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">That...that prosecutor loves the sound of his own voice!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Serialised detective stories are pathetic, are they?! How dare he?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... Maybe let's pick our battles here...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">My Lord, might I be allowed to speak?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As judicial assistant, you may speak for the defence, yes. Go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The prosecution may consider the idea a fantasy... ...but what the defence has postulated was believable enough to persuade the jury to change its leaning. And as such...the court has a duty to explore this alternative explanation as thoroughly as possible!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">To that end... ......... ...juror number four - Mrs Joan Garrideb...must be called to testify and submit to cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Saints alive! A cross-examination of a juror?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well...this, this is highly irregular. It is unprecedented for a member of the jury to be summoned to the witness stand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">L-Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There are already witnesses in the stand whose testimony the defence may further cross-examine. If my learned friend's farcical theory has any truth in it... ...then both a burning book and a jackknife must have flown through the sky before this couple's eyes. And we must assume they would be able to testify accordingly.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... What say you, witnesses?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... Yes, SAH! Constable Roly Beate reporting for duty, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well... Good morning, Officer.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Sorry for dozing until now, sah! I haven't slept for a month, on account of a villain who's appeared on my beat, sah.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, they are so heroic, these 'London bobbies'.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Patricia, my darling, I've been neglecting you. But no more!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh Roly, my hero! You make me swoon!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. I hereby reject the defence's request...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...and order the witnesses in the stand to testify again. State forthwith before the court any details pertaining to the defence's alternative explanation of events.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes...SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">This case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb. Believe me, a London bobby is good for his word!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Obviously, if anything had been thrown out of the window, we would have seen it.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">I didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah! Nothing strange to report on that front, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, this is quite startling. Top-hinged casement windows!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That detail was not in the police report, Constable.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Ah, yes, um... Sorry about that. I...must have been a little drowsy... Ahem.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You cannot excuse your sins with drowsiness every time, Constable.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">No, SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...sorry, but... ...what exactly is a top-hinged casement window?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And you... You cannot excuse your ignorance with such trite remarks, my learned friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Of course...sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've found it, Mr Naruhodo! Cast your mind back to the windows in Mr and Mrs Garrideb's room...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright, I'll try...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">So the window opens in order to allow air to circulate inside the house. But as it's a top-hinged casement window, it swings open along the upper edge, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I'm glad you've rectified your ignorance. A casement window's most prominent feature... ...is its 'stay' - a metal bar which prevents the window from being opened beyond a certain amount.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It, it prevents it opening? <thought>This is all news to me!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">Absolutely correct, sah! In other words, if a book or knife were to have been thrown through the open window... ...it would have clattered against the pane and fallen straight down to the pavement below.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You see the problem, then? Good...your education in windows is complete. There was never any possibility of either the book or the knife travelling fifteen yards over the road. That is, unless the window pane had been shattered... something we've discounted already.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Th-That can't... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Did you see that, Roly? That young Japanese man just collapsed in agony!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Oh yes, my darling. I saw it. I saw how he crumbled before me.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, Roly! You're so strong!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>How is this happening? I haven't even started the cross-examination yet, and already my argument's been destroyed.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, if you could drag yourself upright again...the court awaits your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...My Lord. <thought>Oh good. Another desperate situation...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">This case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb. Believe me, a London bobby is good for his word!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you say that for certain?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">...A very good question, sah. And the answer...is this! It has the noble founding principles of the force written on it as a reminder to all us policemen of our sworn duty.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He showed us that before, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Did he? <thought>I can't say I remember.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">To patrol the streets of London town and uphold the peace of the common man... It's what the job's all about! And that is why I can stand here today beside my long-suffering wife and tell you a bobby's good for his word! ...While rubbing my tired eyes admittedly...SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, Roly...you're so manly!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Of course I am, my darling Patricia!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... No, none of this is what I meant. I meant, how can you say for certain that this case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Ah, I see, sah! You should have said so earlier, sah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, well... So, could you answer the question? <thought>That was a waste of time, then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">Absolutely, sah! I will answer it to the fullest of my abilities, sah! There's a surprising reason why Mr and Mrs Garrideb's domestic dispute can't be related to this case. ...But before I get into that, sah, just one thing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">I'd very much like you and all your countrymen to understand the great British institution of Scotland Yard. So I hope you'll take back some tales of us London bobbies and how we uphold our guiding principles.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I wasn't planning on going back just yet. I've only just arrived here.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">So to that end - SAH! - I'd be happy to lend you my warrant card for your perusal. But I must warn you...you won't be able to get through it without shedding a few tears!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Thank you. I'll...try.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, can I ask you something? ...Please, Mr Lawyer, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Um...yes, of course. What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">You're, you're doubting us, aren't you? I can tell!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! I, I wasn't really... I mean... <thought>What's she doing?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Please. Just because I'm a woman, it doesn't make my testimony any less valuable. You might just see me as the wife of a policeman, but I'm a woman of my word, I am!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...I really don't remember ever suggesting that I doubted you...</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No excuses! I don't want to hear it! My voice will be heard! My Lord, you'll let me speak, won't you?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mrs Beate, I will allow you to supplement your testimony if you so desire. ...Sometimes the path of least resistance is the sage one.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That was a very loud mutter...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I heard that! That Japanese man thinks a policeman's wife's word counts for nothing, does he? Well watch out, sir! I might let you get away with something like that, but my Roly won't!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Duly noted, Mrs Beate. Please, I humbly ask you to continue...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What could she possibly be about to say, I wonder...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you say that for certain?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">...A very good question, sah. And the answer...is this! It has the noble founding principles of the force written on it as a reminder to all us policemen of our sworn duty.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He showed us that before, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Did he? <thought>I can't say I remember.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">To patrol the streets of London town and uphold the peace of the common man... It's what the job's all about! And that is why I can stand here today beside my long-suffering wife and tell you a bobby's good for his word! ...While rubbing my tired eyes admittedly...SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, Roly...you're so manly!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Of course I am, my darling Patricia!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... No, none of this is what I meant. I meant, how can you say for certain that this case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Ah, I see, sah! You should have said so earlier, sah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, well... So, could you answer the question? <thought>That was a waste of time, then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">Absolutely, sah! I will answer it to the fullest of my abilities, sah! There's a surprising reason why Mr and Mrs Garrideb's domestic dispute can't be related to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">You see - SAH! - the windows on the top floor of the Garrideb house are top-hinged casements.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">By which you mean they don't open fully...is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, sah! They're just there to allow a bit of air through the house, you see. So they're restricted as to how much they open.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And therefore anything thrown out of the window from inside the room... ...would simply strike the pane and fall to the street directly below. For clarity, allow me to mark the map. Here...is the location where objects would have fallen.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, yes... Directly opposite the scene of the crime, on the other side of the rather wide road.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Would it have been so hard for somebody to mention this top-hinged casement thing before?</thought> Well...I have another question for you, Constable.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">And what would that be, sah?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How do you even know? Why would you have any idea what sort of windows Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house is furnished with?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Ah, well sah... That's very simple. You see, I helped with the investigation yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to add, Mrs Beate?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Hm...? Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You look...well, delighted. Is there some particular reason for that?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, I was just remembering, that's all. We really were...so lucky.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lucky? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Well, of course I feel terrible for the poor woman who was attacked. Don't misunderstand me, please. But we were just so lucky it didn't happen on Roly's beat. It was so close, you see!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... I hadn't realised.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh yes, that street, Briar Road...that's the boundary between Roly's beat and the next one. Isn't that right, my love?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? ...Oh! Y-Yes, that's right. That's the reason I was helping out with interviewing the occupants of the Garrideb household yesterday. Their house is on my beat, you see...sah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, that really was cutting it close then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Constable, I wonder if you could clarify something... If the Garrideb household is on your beat, does that mean that the pavement next to it is as well?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Outside Mr Garrideb's house? Yes, ma'am! The pavement on that side of the road is part of my beat!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see... I was unaware of that.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Just think, if the woman had been attacked just on the other side of Briar Road... ...we would never have been able to go for that meal to celebrate our wedding anniversary! But...that's the life of a bobby, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Extraordinary people, our bobbies. Tirelessly working for the benefit of all Londoners.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Do you know what I think? I think it was the good Lord's way of rewarding my Roly for all his hard work! Don't you think so, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">That must be it, Pat, my love. That must be it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I think perhaps we should make sure we have that information officially on record.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Leave it to me, Mr Naruhodo! I'll take care of it immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">And now it's my turn, I think!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, can I ask you something? ...Please, Mr Lawyer, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Um...yes, of course. What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">You're, you're doubting us, aren't you? I can tell!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! I, I wasn't really... I mean... <thought>What's she doing?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Please. Just because I'm a woman, it doesn't make my testimony any less valuable. You might just see me as the wife of a policeman, but I'm a woman of my word, I am!</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... I hadn't realised.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh yes, that street, Briar Road...that's the boundary between Roly's beat and the next one. Isn't that right, my love?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? ...Oh! Y-Yes, that's right. That's the reason I was helping out with interviewing the occupants of the Garrideb household yesterday. Their house is on my beat, you see...sah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, that really was cutting it close then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Constable, I wonder if you could clarify something... If the Garrideb household is on your beat, does that mean that the pavement next to it is as well?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Outside Mr Garrideb's house? Yes, ma'am! The pavement on that side of the road is part of my beat!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see... I was unaware of that.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Just think, if the woman had been attacked just on the other side of Briar Road... ...we would never have been able to go for that meal to celebrate our wedding anniversary! But...that's the life of a bobby, after all.</line>

<line speaker="Roly">That must be it, Pat, my love. That must be it.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">And now it's my turn, I think!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You helped? In what way?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Various members of the public were questioned in order to gather information about the case.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">That's right, sah. The sad truth is, we're all overworked. So even though it wasn't under the jurisdiction of my own beat, I obviously wanted to help.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see. Well...thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, is it my turn now?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Obviously, if anything had been thrown out of the window, we would have seen it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But according to my notes here, the sun had gone down already and it was dark.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, but Roly and I were strolling along, gazing at the night sky and looking for our lucky star!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">The star that will guide us to eternal happiness!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Can't it guide you to answer the question?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">If a flaming book had cut across the sky in front of us... ...it would have lit up like a shooting star.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">And if I'd seen a shooting star, I would have made a wish upon it! 'Let Roly be an inspector,' I would have said! Three times at least!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Of course, what with the smog and everything, we couldn't actually see any stars...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...In short, are you trying to say that neither a book nor a knife crossed the sky before you?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, sah, that is correct, SAH! As sure as the night sky in London is starless, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm... It certainly seems like they're telling the truth...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">And then we saw the poor woman fall to the ground, so we ran straight over to help her.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I did leave the scene to go and fetch help, but my trusty Roly was there to make sure nothing was disturbed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you said that you went to a nearby police box to fetch another officer. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right, yes. If it had been on Roly's beat, I would have known exactly where I was going, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Don't feel bad, my love. You can't be expected to know the location of every police box on every beat.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">So Roly told me the way. Only...I sort of got a little lost on the way.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Patricia, my darling...that's why I love you. Your terrible sense of direction is bewitching to me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Oh, please...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">So, I suppose I was gone for about fifteen minutes. But like I said, my Roly was at the scene the whole time, making sure nothing was disturbed!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">I was off duty at the time, of course, but...a true bobby is never really off duty, SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I know what I saw. My eyes never let me down! ...My sense of direction is a little off sometimes, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Beate, nobody is questioning what you've told us.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I saw it, I did! That evening, I saw it clearly! That little Eastern man with the whiskers and the funny curved back, slinking away from the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">And I know what I didn't see, as well. I didn't see any flaming books or knives flying through the sky!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...All very clear. You, you also mentioned something about having a poor sense of direction?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh...yes...well. That's a little embarrassing, really. I'm always ending up at the wrong place when I've made arrangements to meet Roly. He gets ever so cross!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate! ...Is there a problem?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... Eh? Ah...hm? Ah, no sah... No problem, sah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did your wife's remark just now bring something to mind, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Oh, um...well...in a way, sah...yes, sah. I, I was just remembering that the same thing happened that evening, is all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! You mean, Mrs Beate lost her way? On the night of the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Well, you see, I sent her off to find a police box in the next beat over from mine. But she was gone a fair bit longer than what I was expecting. I thought she'd be back inside ten minutes, but my darling was gone a good fifteen.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, Roly! You're such a tease! But the reason I was so long was because of the bouquet, silly.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">...The bouquet?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, what bouquet are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, it was a present for our wedding anniversary. ...Roly's so romantic! He saved up for it with farthings and ha'pennies he found in the gutter while doing his rounds!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...how romantic!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I'd forgotten all about it until just now. ...Had you, my darling?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Aaaaaaaaah! Hm? ...Ah! Oh, yes... But that...was just...between us... No talking about it to anyone else, darling. You have to promizzz...</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Really? ...Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>What was that all about? Constable Beate looked very obviously troubled during that exchange...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid I can't offer any useful insight, Mr Naruhodo. But I'm quite sure of one thing: We have to ask Mrs Beate about the bouquet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Beate! This bouquet you just mentioned... I'd like you to add details about it to your testimony, please.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, really?! Yes, I'd love to!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh well...we've all made mistakes like that from time to time, I'm sure!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">...I got the wrong church on the day of our wedding, I remember. It caused a terrible kerfuffle. I very nearly got married to someone I'd never even met before!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That would most certainly not do, madam. Anyway...continue with your testimony, please, Constable.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What happened was, I dropped my bouquet and ended up losing my way for a while.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean you dropped the bouquet at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Yes, that's right. Oh, I was so upset. When we ran over and saw it was a woman with a knife in her back... ...I was so shocked, I dropped the bouquet Roly gave me. It was in a dark spot where the streetlights weren't casting any light, so I didn't notice at first.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And then you went to the police box to report it to the policeman whose beat it was on?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Yes! And I came back to the scene together with the other constable, you see. That's when I spotted my bouquet again. But the funny thing was, when I went to pick it up... ...it was nowhere near the victim's body at all!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...In case you need reminding, Mrs Beate, the victim is not deceased.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I was all flustered for a moment before I heard a voice calling me from the other side of the road.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Your husband, presumably?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right! Silly me, I'd gone over to the wrong side of the street! Although I'm going to blame the bouquet this time. I can't think how it got there, I really can't.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So the bouquet somehow moved from one side of Briar Road to the opposite...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...curious indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Isn't it? ...But the worst of it is, I forgot to pick the bouquet up again when we left the scene! That beautiful rose Roly bought me! With that change from the gutter he spent so long collecting!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... By 'bouquet'... ...do you perhaps mean this sorry, solitary rose?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh! OOOOOOH! Yes! Yes, that's it! That's the bouquet Roly bought me for our anniversary...with old bits of change he found in the gutter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Maybe just call it a rose.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Tell us, Lord van Zieks, where did you come by the flower?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">According to the report by the police officer in charge of the crime scene investigation... ...it was found on the edge of the pavement in front of the Garrideb household.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>In front of the Garridebs' house?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Although it wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light. It was believed to be of no relevance to the case, since it was found on the opposite side of the thoroughfare.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you! Could I have it back now, please?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... No, I think for good measure, this rose should be added to the Court Record as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">But...it's a symbol of our love... I want it back after the trial! Do you hear me? I want it back!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! Rest, rest assured that I shall do my very best not to forget, Mrs Beate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean you dropped the bouquet at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Yes, that's right. Oh, I was so upset. When we ran over and saw it was a woman with a knife in her back... ...I was so shocked, I dropped the bouquet Roly gave me. It was in a dark spot where the streetlights weren't casting any light, so I didn't notice at first.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And then you went to the police box to report it to the policeman whose beat it was on?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Yes! And I came back to the scene together with the other constable, you see. That's when I spotted my bouquet again. But the funny thing was, when I went to pick it up... ...it was nowhere near the victim's body at all!</line>

<line speaker="Patricia">That's right! Silly me, I'd gone over to the wrong side of the street! Although I'm going to blame the bouquet this time. I can't think how it got there, I really can't.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So the bouquet somehow moved from one side of Briar Road to the opposite...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...curious indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">An English rose... It's such a beautiful flower.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, this is a rose, is it? I've never seen one before.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do you not take an interest in flowers, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wouldn't say that exactly. But I do know three types, at least.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh...three?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, plum blossom, peach blossom and cherry blossom.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps...you should consider branching out? Learning some that aren't fruit tree-based, for example?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's very stylish paper the flower's wrapped in, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's...just an old newspaper, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... I suppose it's because I'm not used to seeing English print. It looks so exotic to me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, I...see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! No no. I was just thinking that if you wrapped a stone-baked sweet potato in English newspaper... ...it might look like some sort of fancy cake.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ah, Susato-san, you do love your cakes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">I didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah! Nothing strange to report on that front, sah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Nothing to report'...?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">That's correct, sah. I had my eyes wide open the entire time. Never looked away for a second. No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it. I can swear to that on the Yard's honour, SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? That...seems a little strange.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Beg your pardon, sah? Strange, sah? Seems altogether regular to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This burnt copy of 'The Lion's Pride' was originally in the Garrideb household. So the question remains, how did it find its way into the hand of the victim? Can you shed any light on that, seeing as you were at the scene of the crime the entire time?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... ...Ah-ha! Could it be a different copy, sah? One that just happened to be burnt as well?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Even if that were possible, why would the victim have been gripping a book like that in her hand? As we can see from this photographic print, she had a bag over her shoulder.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... Well, SAH! That book was in the lady's hand from the moment we arrived at the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Is that so? <thought>There's something about this statement that's not sitting right with me. The two mysteries of how that knife ended up in her back, and how that book ended up in her hand... There must be some common thread between them...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, can I ask you something? ...Please, Mr Lawyer, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Um...yes, of course. What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">You're, you're doubting us, aren't you? I can tell!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! I, I wasn't really... I mean... <thought>What's she doing?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Please. Just because I'm a woman, it doesn't make my testimony any less valuable. You might just see me as the wife of a policeman, but I'm a woman of my word, I am!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...I really don't remember ever suggesting that I doubted you...</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No excuses! I don't want to hear it! My voice will be heard! My Lord, you'll let me speak, won't you?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mrs Beate, I will allow you to supplement your testimony if you so desire. ...Sometimes the path of least resistance is the sage one.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That was a very loud mutter...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I heard that! That Japanese man thinks a policeman's wife's word counts for nothing, does he? Well watch out, sir! I might let you get away with something like that, but my Roly won't!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Duly noted, Mrs Beate. Please, I humbly ask you to continue...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What could she possibly be about to say, I wonder...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm so sorry, Mr Naruhodo. I had no right to speak out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wh-What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I requested the cross-examination of Mrs Garrideb without consulting you. ...Even if the judge did deny me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see. Well, I agree with you. We do need testimony from Mrs Garrideb... ...if we're ever going to get to the truth of this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! Do you really think so?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, think about it. No matter how far it is across the road or how that window opens... ...Mr Garrideb's book found its way to the scene of the crime somehow, didn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And then there was Mrs Garrideb's reaction to me showing her the knife. ...The woman's hiding something, I'm sure of it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're right again!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We need to use this cross-examination to uncover more clues. We'll get to the bottom of this one way or another, I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, Mr Naruhodo... What do you make of all this?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, yes... ...the whole idea of an invisible attacker has been troubling me all along. But I believe I'm starting to get a picture of what really happened here now.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The fourth book that had no business being at the scene of the crime... ...made me sure that Mrs Garrideb was hiding something from us. But it's becoming increasingly clear...that someone else has been hiding something from us as well. <thought>I think I may already be armed with everything I need to strike a decisive blow here. This time...it's going to expose the whole truth about this mysterious affair.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You claim, Constable Beate, there was 'nothing to report' in the fifteen or so minutes you were guarding the scene. But that cannot be.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What...what do you mean to say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In your testimony just now, Mrs Beate, you explained to the court... ...that when you arrived back at the scene of the crime with the policeman assigned to that beat... ...the bouquet you had dropped at the victim's side was no longer anywhere nearby.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes, on the opposite side of Briar Road to where the victim was attacked. But considering the size of that meagre 'bouquet' - if a single, sorry bloom can be so described... ...no doubt it was blown in the wind across the street, back into the gutter where it belongs.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Meagre...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if that were the case... ...why did Constable Beate not testify to the fact?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it.' Constable Beate swore to that on Scotland Yard's honour.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">But the bouquet belonged to me! It has nothing to do with the case. That's...that's why Roly didn't mention it, I'm sure!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, because sadly it's not only your bouquet we're talking about here. More than one thing in this case is mysteriously the wrong way round!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Think about it... Besides Mrs Beate's bouquet...there's Mr Garrideb's book! Mr Garrideb's copy of 'The Lion's Pride', which was thrown out of the window by his wife... ...would have struck the pane of the casement window and landed here, on the west side of the street. And yet... ...it was actually found here, on the opposite side of the road, in the victim's hand. Meanwhile, according to the testimony we've heard, Mrs Beate's bouquet... ...should have been dropped here, at the scene of the crime, on the east end of the street. But in fact... ...it was actually found here, on the opposite side of the road, in front of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house. There's no logical explanation for those things... ...unless somebody deliberately moved them!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What are you trying to say? The way you're talking, it sounds like you think my Roly's done something wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Don't you listen to a word that scrawny lawyer says! Wittering on about books and bouquets... Why should we care? It's nitpicking, that's what it is!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Oh good. Mrs Garrideb's come round.</thought> You might call it nitpicking, Mrs Garrideb... ...but deliberately meddling with the scene of a crime is a criminal offence. It's called, um...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...'Tampering', Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the person responsible for this tampering cannot admit to it... ...for a very subtle, but compelling reason.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, there is someone who tampered with the scene of the crime that evening. All the evidence and all the testimony points to that one particular person...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, I must demand that you substantiate this conjecture. Who are you saying is responsible for tampering with the scene of the crime? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Do you intend to share your internal monologue, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, My Lord, I was just taking a moment to get things straight in my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And for that moment of wasted court's time...you will pay the price!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>Is it me or are things getting more strict around here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">What you were thinking is right, Mr Naruhodo. There is only one person who had the opportunity to tamper with the scene of the crime. There can be no mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I, I thought so! <thought>There's no point overthinking this. There's really only one option.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">I need an answer, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously, there's only one person it could have been. Constable Roly Beate, it was you!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What?! A policeman?! A member of Scotland Yard?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What nonsense! Why would my Roly do something like that? There's no one straighter than my husband! No bobby works more tirelessly for the people of London!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Beate... ...you said in your testimony that your husband asked you to go to a nearby police box to fetch the officer on duty. The fifteen minutes that you were absent from the scene is the only opportunity anyone had to tamper with it.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">You're making it up! It's all nonsense! It's all lies! What about that Japanese man with the whiskers? I bet it was him! He did it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If that was true, Constable Beate would have seen him do it!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And forgive me for pointing it out, but when you dropped your bouquet, Mrs Beate... ...it was after the defendant had fled the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Argh! Well...well...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">First you make accusations about the landlord and his wife...and now you incriminate a policeman as well. But your accusations lack one very important thing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You claim the crime scene was tampered with. But there is only one reason anyone would commit such a reckless crime: To hide something.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's right! He's right! But my husband and I just happened to be there, that's all! So why would we have anything to hide? It doesn't make sense!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You've offered no motive for this alleged tampering. And until you do...your accusations are nothing but empty threats!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Constable Beate had a very good reason for wanting to tamper with the scene of the crime. That's the key to this entire affair.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, have you...? Have you managed to solve this mystery?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, you have made a very serious accusation against a London police officer. If you are mistaken, I'm sure I need not point out that your reputation as a lawyer will be irrevocably damaged. ...With that stark warning in mind, you will now explain to the court the motive for this alleged tampering.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. ......... Constable Beate's motive for tampering with the crime scene was to hide...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Where the book fell to the ground. That's what he had to cover up at all costs.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... And why, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?! Oh, well, of course, the reason is...erm... .........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Do you have something to hide, my learned friend? For it seems you're unwilling to share the reason with the court.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Or could it be, perhaps...that no reason exists?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! <thought>He didn't even try to hide his displeasure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Where the bouquet fell to the ground. That's what he had to cover up at all costs.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... And why, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?! Oh, well, of course, the reason is...erm... .........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Do you have something to hide, my learned friend? For it seems you're unwilling to share the reason with the court.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Or could it be, perhaps...that no reason exists?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! <thought>He didn't even try to hide his displeasure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Where the victim fell to the ground! That is what this bobby had to cover up at all costs!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Where the victim fell? You, you mean where she was attacked? What are you talking about? We told you at the very start, didn't we?! On the pavement of Briar Road! We saw it happen, remember? It was right here...as if anyone didn't already know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's certainly what everybody has been led to believe. But in fact...that isn't where the victim was stabbed at all.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Wha...? WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm beginning to wonder where this tumultuous trial will end, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If that's your assertion...then the court is dying to know, my Nipponese friend... ...where are you proposing that the crime actually took place that evening?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Or to be more precise... ...in the exact location where that student in mourning dress stands.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. And the criminal must be duly punished for his sins.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Now we've been condemned, there is nothing more to say. Except perhaps... ...'That behaviour was really very out of character for the accused, My Lord.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright! I'll think again...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But, but that's...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On the opposite side of the road?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">I, I don't understand...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the evening in question... ...Mr Garrideb's book fell directly down from the open window above. And your bouquet, Mrs Beate, never moved at all. What did move...was the scene of the crime itself!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good... GOOD GRACIOUS!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">That's, that's right! I saw it! With my own eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was five o'clock in the evening and already dark. There was the typical London fog on the ground. When you saw the incident unfold and ran to the victim's aid... ...that was actually on the west side of Briar Road.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">No! That's not true! It, it can't have been!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate then arranged for you to be absent for a while by sending you for help. And during the fifteen minutes you were away, he transplanted the crime scene. He moved all the things shown in this print: the victim herself...the four books... He moved everything in fact...to the pavement on the east side of Briar Road!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Extraordinary...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the constable overlooked one thing.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">What? What did he overlook?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The bouquet, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The prosecution told the court just a few minutes ago about the discovery of the rose bouquet. Lord van Zieks said, 'It wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light.'</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, it couldn't be seen in the dark, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which is why it was only the bouquet... ...that was found in its original position, on the pavement on the west side of Briar Road.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that...is the defence's theory about what really happened that evening. How do you respond... ...Constable Roly Beate?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... Um...well...I'm... Very sorry. I didn't mean to nod off again. But I haven't slept properly...in a month. Did I miss...anything...important...?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh Roly... ...it isn't true, is it? What that lawyer said is all lies, isn't it? I know it is, because you're the most upstanding, righteous man I know!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... I had...a dream... A terrible dream... All the thingzzz...I did that night... Everything...come out... Everything...expozzz'd...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Only...it seemzzz... ...it...wasn't a dream at all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good... GOOD GOLLY! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! What on earth is the meaning of all this?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh Roly, why? Why would you do something like this? Moving a corpse is...is...is a criminal offence, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Wishing the victim dead should be one, too.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Constable, explain yourself! Why would you do this? As a respected member of Scotland Yard, your duty is to protect the good people of London town!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... I, I can't say...sah.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">WHAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">I really am ever so sorry about all this. For damaging the Yard's reputation... For...for everything...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I have a possible explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For why, on that particular evening... ...Constable Beate felt compelled to move the scene of the crime. I can think of one reason.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?! How could you possibly know? You - a foreigner - presuming to understand the mind of a Scotland Yard policeman!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And yet, Lord van Zieks, it is this foreigner who has uncovered the startling truth of the matter thus far.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe it would be beneficial to the court to hear this extraordinary young lawyer's theory. Counsel for the Defence, if you please...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then...I think you had better show us some evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">At once, My Lord. <thought>England... Japan... It makes no difference where you come from, human emotions are the same. And I think I have a fairly good idea of the feelings behind this man's actions...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">What gives away the motive for Constable Beate's unthinkable actions?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I'm sorry to say that I don't, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAAGH! <thought>Maybe...I was too unthinking...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">England... Japan... It makes no difference where you come from, Mr Naruhodo. Human emotions are the same.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...what I was thinking, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And I think you have a fairly good idea of the feelings behind Constable Beate's actions...don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You seem to have a good idea of my own thoughts and feelings, Miss Susato. Perhaps too good an idea!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...I heard you muttering to yourself before, you see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I realise that I'm a foreigner in this land. And I have only just arrived from Japan. Which is why all this information about London's so-called 'bobbies' is completely new to me. I've learnt that, though honourable, 'patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world', for example.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Keeping the peace, looking after the citizens on his beat in all kinds of ways... There's no doubt that the young bobby is charged with a great deal to do each day, certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But for Constable Beate, the day in question was special.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Special? How?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On account of this bouquet, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh yes! It was our very first wedding anniversary!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate had worked so hard to be able to afford this simple gift for his wife... ...and was so looking forward to taking her out for a celebratory meal...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...When he and Mrs Beate stumbled upon a crime along Briar Road. When he saw that shadowy figure through the fog collapse on the pavement ahead of them... ...what must have gone through the man's mind?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">But SAH! Just on that one particular day, I was looking forward to celebrating my wedding anniversary. Mrs Beate puts up with a lot being married to a bobby like me. I wanted to show my dear wife how much I care!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the warrant card that Constable Beate offered to lend to me earlier. Inside, among the rules for patrolling policemen, it says... ...'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah ha!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate... ...is that or is that not the reason why you moved the whole scene of the crime that day?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... Yes... Everything you said... It's all right...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... So that's it... It was all to do with the boundary of your beat.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. To summarise... ...the incident actually occurred on Constable Beate's beat.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! Constable! Do you realise the gravity of what you have done?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... It...was the first time since I became a copper... ...that I'd ever cursed God. 'Stay close to me, Pat! The criminal could still be lurking somewhere!'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Constable...</line>
<line speaker="Roly">I...I just wanted... Just that one night... To take my Patricia out for dinner.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh Roly...</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Just that one night. .........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You knew that if the incident was on your beat, your evening of celebration would be ruined. And so you decided...to move the entire crime scene outside your jurisdiction. Just across the street, to the east pavement of Briar Road... which falls under the neighbouring beat's care.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... You see, I... I thought ...Well, I was sure the victim was dead, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh, of course he did! Otherwise my Roly would never have left the poor woman on the freezing cold pavement!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Ah, I see your meaning now.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... But God got me back for my sins, didn't He? That's why... That's why I missed the rose I bought for Pat.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh no, Roly! That was all my fault! I should never have dropped it in such a dark place... I'm so sorry, Roly!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... And can you tell us, Constable... ...how many books did you move from the one side of the road to the other in total?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? Oh! ...Um... Four, it was. Yes, sah. ...Definitely...four.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Three of them dropped by Mr Natsume, and the fourth... ...being the one that fell from the window upstairs in the Garrideb household, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...what made you place that book in the victim's hand? When all the others were scattered haphazardly around, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Oh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">'How you found it'? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">When we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're sure it was this book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that the victim was holding?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Oh yes, sah. No doubt about it...sah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm...interesting...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roly">......... I thought it was an open-and-shut case at the time, you see. There were only the two people at the scene. And Pat and me both saw it happen. However which way you looked at it, it had to be the fellow who ran off who'd done it...I thought. I couldn't see the harm, really. I didn't think moving it all over the road would make a jot of difference. I... I suppose this is it for me now. I've had it...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I believe...that concludes the cross-examination of the witnesses.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Constable...you may withdraw.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes, SAH!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Um, Mr Prosecutor, sir... ...what will become of my Roly? What will happen to him?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... For now, you are free to go home. The police will contact you in due course.</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Please...don't punish my husband! This, this was all my fault! It's because I'm always moaning at him for coming home late!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Leave it now, Pat. ...Let's go home. I'm...tired...</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">...Alright then, my love.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">One last thing, Constable...</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Sah?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let this be a lesson to you. In a criminal investigation, every detail matters, however insignificant it may seem to you.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Yes...sah...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Carve that lesson in your mind. And never again make the mistake of tampering with the scene of a crime.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Ah?! N-Never again, sah? You, you mean to say...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Leave. Now. This trial is not yet over.</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Uh...um... SAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, quite a startling revelation, I must say. Whoever thought of a third party transplanting the entire scene of a crime like that!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Indeed, My Lord. Nevertheless, there are some immutable facts here. Principally... ...that the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume, is the only person who could possibly have committed this crime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! I disagree. Now that we know the true scene of the incident...there is someone else. Another person who could be responsible for the knife in the victim's back!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Forgive me for being presumptuous... ...but I believe the prosecution is probably well aware of this possibility already.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks! Is this true?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Very well. Name the person if you will. And if further investigation is warranted... ...the prosecution has no objection to the trial continuing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will name this 'other person' who could have perpetrated the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I dare say my learned friend's timid tone is a reflection of the confidence he has in his answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph, so that's what all the sweat is about, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAGH! <thought>We've already managed to establish where the victim actually collapsed. I'm sure that means... ...we must nearly be at the end of the line!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, I say again...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence would once again like to request the cross-examination of a new witness, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Once again?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My assistant made the same request earlier. In order to finally reveal the truth about this case... ...it's imperative that we cross-examine juror number four...Mrs Joan Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Me? Me?! Oh dearie me!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the situation is very different now! Mrs Garrideb, answer me this...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">What do you want now, you little toad?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">At the time of the incident, you were engaged in a violent argument with your husband, Mr John Garrideb. In the course of the argument, a minor house fire was ignited... ...and to clear the smoke from the room, your husband opened a window that looks out over Briar Road.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well, what of it?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You threw this book at your husband, when he was cornered with his back against the window. Upon striking the pane of the open top-hinged casement window, the book plummeted directly down... ...finding its way... ...to what we now know to be the true scene of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Yes, and as I said, what of it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">During the argument, you were beside yourself with rage. As such, you threw not just books, but anything you could lay your hands on.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...let me ask you one more time, Mrs Garrideb... This knife - the one removed from the victim's back... Have you really never laid eyes on it before?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ah... ......... ............ ...I don't recall it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Seriously...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Am I supposed to remember everything I picked up and threw at my husband? And anyway, the man over there in all that regalia said members of the jury needn't testify, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Conveniently, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Make no mistake... You jurors are not special in any way. You are not immune to the judicial process. If you know something about this knife, madam...let the truth come out.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">But! But that's just a common-or-garden knife! It could have come from anywhere. We have several like that at home. If, if one went missing... ...how would you expect me to know?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Are you joking?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What are you saying, please, Mrs Garrideb?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I, I refuse to believe all this nonsense! I couldn't bear the thought that I'd injured someone. Do you hear? I couldn't bear it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, the poor woman...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">So...yes! I want evidence! I want to see hard evidence if you're going to insist on this being my fault! You're going to have to prove to me that I threw that knife if that's what you think. Come along now! Chop chop! ...Do your worst!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If, if I had evidence like that, believe me, I would have thrown it at her already!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then take the stand, juror!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution does not object to the defence's request to cross-examine this woman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you, Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I... I'm going to have to testify?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Juror number four... ...as I'm sure you will appreciate, having observed it with your own eyes today... ...witness testimony can lead to the most extraordinary truths being unearthed. Truths of which the witnesses themselves may not even have been aware.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh dearie me...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So I demand your full and unadulterated testimony, Mrs Garrideb. And mark my words: In this court of law today...we shall extract the truth! Do you concur, Counsels?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Certainly, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Um... ...That's what I'm hoping for, My Lord! <thought>This is such a strange feeling... For the first time since arriving in this country, it actually feels real. I'm here, in the Old Bailey...and I'm a lawyer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Witness, state your name and occupation.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh...ah... Yes, my name is Joan Garrideb... ...and I'm...um...well... I'm a juror...and suchlike.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It sounds like even she doesn't know if she's a housewife or a maid or what any more...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court has decided your testimony is required in order to clarify matters in this case. ...Do you understand, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">...Yes! ...My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You will tell the court everything that took place in your household on the evening in question. And I warn you... Do not attempt to hide the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh... Oh dearie me...</line>
<line speaker="???">...Chin up, Joanie. Nothing to worry about now.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh! I didn't know you were here, John!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Wasn't only you in the room that day, old thing, was it? Rather think I ought to testify as well, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">But...but what about your knee, dear?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Don't you worry about that. Hardly notice it! I'm not the sort of chap to leave a comrade to face disciplinary action alone.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh, John...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I presume you are Mr John Garrideb?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Yes, sir! Former second lieutenant of the third regiment of the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir! Seen my fair share of action and now living the quiet life, as it were.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...The quiet life? Were you not engaged in an incendiary battle with your spouse on the day in question?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Ah...well...yes... Ahem! Quite.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe this may represent a first in the proud history of the British court. Calling a juror to the witness stand is unprecedented. However, the court will hear your testimony now, juror number four, and that of your husband. You will recount clearly and concisely the events in your home at the time of the incident in question.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Sir! At once!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Yes, on the day you're referring to, the wife and I did have a bit of a skirmish. Can't recall the reason now.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Meanwhile...I was picking up whatever I could find to throw at him.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Plenty of knives around our place. Can't say I'd notice if one or two went missing, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... It sounds as though it was quite the battlefield in your household that evening.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Although an entirely one-sided assault, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">The enemy caught us on the hop, sir. Had no choice but to dig in and take defensive measures. To be honest, if the enemy had kept shelling us for another minute, we'd have been toast. 'Course, a veteran such as myself... ...is only too aware that on every battlefield, you're just a gnat's whisker from death at any moment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Are we still talking about a marital quarrel here?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well... ...I must say I'm dubious that this testimony will shed any light on the origins of this jackknife.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In combat, one's focus narrows such that surroundings are barely noticed. These witnesses may not be able to offer anything more than they have testified already. This may be a dead end.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Van Zieks may well be right.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, whatever the chances... ...we only have this last cross-examination to uncover the truth, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I'm afraid so.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Counsel. Begin your cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Yes, on the day you're referring to, the wife and I did have a bit of a skirmish. Can't recall the reason now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The reason...is what you told us yesterday, I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's right. If I remember correctly... ...it all started because of a note that was tucked into the pages of a book belonging to Mr Garrideb.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A rather passionate note, in fact. But Mrs Garrideb found the note, discovering her husband's little secret.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And she gave him a mighty number of slaps across the face for it, too!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...What a sordid state of affairs.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Hell on earth.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">......... I say! When a chap says he can't recall such things, it's common decency not to drag it all up! And besides, half of it was wide of the mark, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">A likely story!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...These waters run veeery deep.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what transpired next, after these multiple blows to the face?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Knocked a candlestick over and set fire to the carpet! Soon had it out, though, and got the window open.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the fire also spread to some items of furniture, didn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">The bookcase...my armchair... Anything of mine, really. Just so happens there was some bathwater around that evening, so I sloshed that about to put it out.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...A most precarious situation you put yourself in.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Ours is a three-storey town house on the west side of the street, where the water main isn't connected yet. Have to draw water from a public water pump during the day if you need any, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">The lodgers are always moaning that they can't get any water at night. Although, that little moustached Japanese man buys water in bottles, I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defendant, Mr Natsume, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Yes. He receives a stipend for his studies, you know. From his home country. Can you imagine? Being able to brew a pot of tea at all hours... He's obviously very well off.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Have you actually seen the state of the man?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe he uses all of his income to buy books.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Well anyway, the point is, I was able to douse the fire with water, fortunately enough.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Meanwhile...I was picking up whatever I could find to throw at him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Even though the room was on fire?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">As far as I was concerned at the time... ...it was more important to extinguish my anger than the flames. When a woman wants to throw, she must throw!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That is most certainly not true of a Susato Takedown, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>How did she know I was thinking that?</thought> So...please cast your mind back and try to remember... Was a knife among the items that you threw at your husband that day?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">......... In all honesty, I don't recall. But I feel I must point out...that I'm no monster. Let me see... Some bread...a cabbage...garlic... A towel...and a sponge... A napkin...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to add, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Hm? Eh! Don't shoot! ...Ah, sorry...I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did your wife's remark just now bring something to mind?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Nothing of any significance, no. Just that the barrage of projectiles the old thing launched in my direction... ...was somewhat more solid than she implies. Books...bricks...and the fire poker, I seem to recall.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Ouch.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">And the woman's aim is uncanny! She landed a direct hit with every bally- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! Good grief, woman! We're not at home now! This is a court of law!</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh dearie me! ...Ever so sorry, dear.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...What's she even doing with a teapot in here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Joan">Honestly, John, I would never have thrown such things at you, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Well take a look at this, then. How do you suppose that happened, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your pipe, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Had this thing in my hand as usual at the time of the onslaught. Knocked it clean out with one of her 'soft' projectiles, she did! Yes... And when I went to pick the thing up, it was broken in two. ...I'd like to see a sponge do that sort of damage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see, your pipe was broken...</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">It would never have been sent flying unless it was hit by something pretty solid. Anyway, I've managed to bandage the thing up for now.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Haah...you are one to exaggerate, aren't you, dear?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm...I wonder what we should make of this account...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence believes Mr Garrideb's remarks just now to be of great significance!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. Common sense, one might say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Might one?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">In that case, would you at least permit us to examine the pipe, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Hm? Well, I...don't see why not.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh dearie me! There you go again, trying to ingratiate yourself with a young lady...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, the court will accept the gentleman's pipe as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I hope I didn't speak out of turn, Mr Naruhodo. I, I was just feeling rather disappointed for you that your request was turned down.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no, it's fine. <thought>Thanks to Susato-san, we have some new evidence to work with. We should examine it carefully.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, thank you for that...rebuttal, Mr Garrideb. Now, if we could return to the crux of the matter. What can you tell the court about the knife used to attack the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I don't know much about pipes... ...but it's hard to see how what Mr Garrideb just said could be of any real significance.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, thank you for that...rebuttal, Mr Garrideb. Now, if we could return to the crux of the matter. What can you tell the court about the knife used to attack the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">It was really only soft items I was throwing. And I was really most restrained. The majority of them barely hit John. ...He is my husband, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see, Mrs Garrideb. Your thoughtfulness and consideration for your spouse is...apparent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What about you, Mr Garrideb? Do you remember what your wife threw at you?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Well, I recall 'The Lion's Pride', of course. Jolly good book. Only just purchased it, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And a jolly good book for burning, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">But it was a dashed awful scene on the battlefield, I can tell you. Flames everywhere...smoke billowing... Couldn't see a bally thing, really. I dare say I wouldn't even have noticed a knife bouncing off the old bonce.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I don't think they tend to bounce, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks to be in a sorry state with that bandage around it, doesn't it? But for some reason, it's slightly ominous to me. Like it's trying to shout out a warning. Probably because it's the same blue as Mr Garrideb's dressing gown...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose it must have considerable sentimental value to Mr Garrideb... ...given that he's gone to the trouble of repairing it like this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Either that, or he can't afford to replace it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...something just twinkled inside the chamber of the pipe there.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I saw it. Something's stuck in there, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's turn it over and give it a shake... Wh...What's this?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's a tiny fragment of metal! It...looks like the tip of a blade or something.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The tip of a blade? <thought>Surely...it couldn't be...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the tiny piece of metal we found in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It...looks like the tip of a blade or something.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The tip of a blade? .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't really know... There's just something niggling me, but I can't quite put my finger on what it is.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps in that case... ...it would be wise to examine some of the other pieces of evidence again?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the tiny piece of metal we found in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe. And what a stroke of luck that it's a perfect fit with the broken tip of the jackknife!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's extraordinary, isn't it? And fills me with a sense of awe. It's surely proof that miracles really can happen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, a more miraculous proof I couldn't ask for...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, look here, Mr Naruhodo, just at the tip... A small piece of the blade appears to be missing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Wait...part of it's missing?</thought> I could be wrong, but I've just got a feeling... You remember this?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! That's... That's the tiny fragment of metal that we found inside Mr Garrideb's pipe!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and just maybe... .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! It's a perfect fit!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Somehow, I just knew it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Who would have thought that the tiny piece of metal we found in Mr Garrideb's pipe... ...would be a perfect fit for the missing tip of the knife from the victim's back?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's extraordinary, isn't it? And fills me with a sense of awe. It's surely proof that miracles really can happen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, a more miraculous proof I couldn't ask for...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Plenty of knives around our place. Can't say I'd notice if one or two went missing, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? ...Would you care to elaborate?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Nothing to say, really. Rather partial to a spot of carving, you see. Pipes and whatnot. Fishing tackle. You know the sort of thing.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">It's a passion we both share. I like to carve little wooden trinkets, too. And then there's my leatherwork.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Sorry to say we're always losing knives about the place. And we have dozens of the things.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">They sell them at the market, sometimes. Twenty for the price of nineteen. Needless to say, I snap them up! John prefers to use two knives at meal times too, instead of a knife and fork.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Now now, Joan, we don't want people thinking I'm some kind of savag- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Here we go again with the scaldings. Why are they being so evasive?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I imagine it's because they don't want to believe it. They can't bear the thought that it might have been one of their knives that injured the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Which is entirely understandable, of course. But still...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Go on with your testimony, witnesses.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Sir!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">If that bally thing in the victim's back really was one of ours, you'll have a job proving it, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you have no intention of admitting it was your knife... unless we can produce proof?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Even though there is no other credible possibility if Mr Natsume is innocent?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...As if I could forget. <thought>If only there was some way to know who had handled the knife. But I suppose wizardry like that is just a dream...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps you're thinking of fingerprinting, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! You, you mean...it's not a dream? That sort of wizardry really exists?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Whenever people touch anything, they leave behind a unique pattern from their skin...or so they say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...But I can't see anything.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There are already countries in the world where these so-called fingerprints can be used as evidence. Lord Stronghart is currently discussing the matter at the Ministry of Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, I believe we are rapidly approaching an era of scientific methods of investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But for now...we shall have to find an alternative method of proving our assertion. That this knife found in the victim's back was originally in Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... If only I could transplant this whole incident to several years in the future...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...That's the extent of their testimony, is it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I think we've heard all this before, to be honest. I can't say I'm particularly confident that we'll be able to prove anything new from this testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...in this cross-examination it's absolutely essential... ...that we establish how this knife came to be at the scene of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I know...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I'm sure both of them must be feeling very worried. Worried that it was in fact a knife belonging to one of them that caused the victim's injury.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If we could find even a tiny shred of evidence to support that theory... ...it would clinch this trial for us. It would explain everything.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes...it would.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So, for Soseki-san's sake, we must. We must find that last crucial piece of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Garrideb. Could I ask you to take a good look at this, please?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">......... You can ask, but I can't see a bally thing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can't?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Used to call me 'Deadeye 'Deb' back in the regiment of course. ...But that was some time ago now. Even when I'm trying to enjoy a large-print book by the fire these days... ...I struggle to tell a 'b' from a 'd' and a 'p' from a 'q', to be honest.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh, he does. Dearie me, it's rather wearing being asked about every other letter in every other word.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You must 'de' very 'dusy'.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What is that? A tiny scrap of metal?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Almost certainly from the tip of a blade. And what may appear at first to be just a tiny scrap...is in fact a crucial piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Interesting. And where did the defence come by this evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was lodged in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">My pipe, you say? By Jove, I wonder how that got there.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what precisely does this fragment of metal signify, Counsel? Are you suggesting that it is in some way related to the matter of the stabbing on Briar Road?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I am!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When put together with another piece of evidence already in the Court Record... ...I believe this tiny fragment of metal will unravel the whole truth of this case, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, you appear rather confident in that extraordinary statement, Counsel. Very well then, present the pertinent evidence to the court! What evidence, when paired with this fragment of metal, allegedly reveals the truth of this entire case?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Do you care to explain yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...sorry. I, I was just thinking to myself... ...and it sort of slipped out.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Here in Great Britain, sir, gentlemen keep their thoughts to themselves.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, yes, of course. We do in the Empire of Japan as well usually, too.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then you shouldn't mind paying the price for shocking the court with that ludicrous outburst.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Shocking the court? You didn't even raise an eyebrow.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We should be able to prove what this fragment of metal really is. The answer is in the Court Record somewhere, I'm quite sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright, I just need to calm down and have another careful look through all the evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the knife that was found in the victim's back. If you look closely, you will see that there is a small piece at the tip of the blade that is missing.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A common issue with the inferior blades sold at unsavoury street markets. Criminals who use them regularly leave the tips lodged in their victims' bones.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what of this particular knife?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No doubt its tip has suffered a similar fate, now languishing somewhere near the spine of the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! That's not the case.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The tip of this particular knife's blade... ...is the very fragment of metal we discovered in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Argh...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I, I don't believe it! The knife from the crime scene and this fragment of metal... ...are a perfect match!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good... GOOD GOLLY GOSH!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is, is this...some sort of Eastern sorcery?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... This is no magic, My Lord. This...is a miracle.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A miracle?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So van Zieks has figured it out, has he?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel! Explain this extraordinary coincidence at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord! The crucial point we have to ask ourselves here... ...is when did the fragment of metal find its way inside Mr Garrideb's pipe?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Something that was clarified for us in the most recent witness testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Had this thing in my hand as usual at the time of the onslaught. Knocked it clean out with one of her 'soft' projectiles, she did! Yes... It would never have been sent flying unless it was hit by something pretty solid.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Oh...dearie...me...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">During the argument between these two that occurred just as the victim was on the pavement below... ...Mrs Garrideb flung this knife at her husband. However... ...the knife missed Mr Garrideb, instead striking the pipe in his hand at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which caused the tip to break off... Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. And that is when the tiny tip of the blade... ...found its way inside Mr Garrideb's pipe!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">The...the chances of that are a million to one!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet there's no other credible explanation for how the tip of the blade ended up in your pipe. Then, after losing its tip, the knife ricocheted off the pipe and flew out of the open window.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In short! This knife, which fell from the window of the Garridebs' house... ...is the very same knife that struck the victim in the middle of the back on the street below!</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh gosh! Oh dear! Oh... ...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A complex bouquet of seemingly trivial points, plausibly arranged to create an almost passable vintage. Allow me to toast my learned friend's characteristically Nipponese approach to bottling his argument.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But after all, it is just a theory. The bottle, I fear, is corked. Because you see... ...it's spoilt by an insurmountable inconsistency!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An insurmountable... ...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks! Explain yourself! What is this inconsistency you claim to have identified?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">An inconsistency of the simplest nature, My Lord. The victim was found with the knife planted in the middle of her back.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, in her- Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Joan">That's right! You silly little man!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Now, Joan old thing... What are you getting so excited about?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let us consider the basic facts of the case once more. The victim was walking along the pavement before being stabbed in the back and falling to the ground. If the knife that struck her had fallen from above... ...there's no possible way it could have planted itself into the victim's back!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar!</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Quite right! You see! That's exactly right! If the knife had fallen on her from above... ...it would have struck her on the top of her head!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...um... .........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... It would appear the defence has made rather a spectacular blunder.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If a theory has even one inconsistency...it cannot stand. Your theory, my learned friend...is history!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>We were so close... I could see the truth... I was so sure we were on the right track... But now the way has been blocked completely...by just one, simple inconsistency!</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Or in other words...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...we simply need to eliminate that one inconsistency, and the theory will stand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Miss Susato!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You mustn't worry, Mr Naruhodo. You were just caught off guard, that's all. And your mind went blank. But if the path you were on is indeed correct, then a way will present itself. The key to this is in the Court Record, I'm sure. All the information you need is there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It seems you have nothing to say, my Nipponese friend. Well, your silence speaks volumes. A tacit acceptance that your theory...is fatally flawed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This inconsistency doesn't mean I was on the wrong track... It means that I need to sharpen my mind and dig deeper for the truth! It's a test!</thought> Yes! If the knife fell on the victim from above, there's no way that it could have hit her in the middle of her back... ...under normal circumstances, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you implying?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can explain this inconsistency. That can explain how the knife that fell from above could have pierced the victim's back. We already have the answer.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Utter...utter madness!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Surely this must be the last time... Counsel, present the evidence of which you speak!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This is the last inconsistency... The final piece in the puzzle. If I can successfully make sense of this...the truth will be laid bare at last!</thought> The evidence that explains how the falling knife became lodged in the victim's back is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That answer appeared to make Mr Garrideb rather lightheaded. But Mrs Garrideb didn't bat an eyelid.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would seem...you've been cut down in your prime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uh-oh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You must watch out for blades falling from the heavens, my learned friend. They may strike at any time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAGH! <thought>Not what you want to hear...from the Reaper! If the knife fell straight down and hit the victim in the middle of her back... ...then her back must have been facing the heavens at the time. But why? What could have happened that might place her in that position?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This - the fourth book found at the scene... This is the final piece of evidence the defence will present!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The burnt book?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is that not Mr Garrideb's book?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. And to understand its significance, we have to consider how it came to be at the scene in the first place. This photographic print clearly shows the book in question... ...and the victim holding it in her hand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But as we all now know... ...it was the police constable that put the book between her fingers like that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Quite so. As part of his wholesale transplanting of the crime scene to the opposite side of the road.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's true. However... ...as part of his testimony, Constable Beate made an extremely enlightening statement on that point.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...what made you place that book in the victim's hand?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Oh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it. When we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words, the victim had already picked the book up of her own volition. And clearly, that must have been before she suffered the knife wound.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, I should say so! After being attacked with a knife, I don't imagine she'd have been doing much of anything.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the question becomes...why did the victim have that book in her hand?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">By...by jingo! I...think I'm beginning to see what may have happened now.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh dearie me...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... We know that the book fell from the top floor of the Garrideb household onto the pavement below. At precisely the moment that the victim was walking past.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, at exactly that moment. The young woman was walking along the street in the light fog... ...when all of a sudden, a book fell right in front of her.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">...The book I threw...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, Mrs Garrideb. And what do you think the woman did? What would you do, if you were walking along and suddenly a book landed in front of you on the pavement?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! That is exactly what the woman in fact did. She picked up the book!</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Oh... Oh heavens! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And when the woman reached down to pick the fallen book up... ...what position would her back have been in? That's right. Facing the sky, completely and utterly defenceless. Then, in the very next moment, while the woman was still bent over picking up the book... ...the next object fell from the room above - the jackknife - straight into the middle of her back. And at that same time... ...walking by chance directly behind Miss Green... ...was the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well I never!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It appeared to Mr Natsume... ...that the woman simply collapsed on the floor. In the dark and the fog, he didn't see the knife falling on her from above.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...And from the other direction... ...the constable and his wife saw no one but the victim and her apparent attacker.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So there never was a 'real culprit' to run from the scene in the first place...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. This was nothing more than a series of unlikely events that culminated in an unfortunate accident. And THAT is the real truth behind this case! Well...Mr and Mrs Garrideb?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">The very first time you showed me that knife, I... I had my suspicions. I wondered if perhaps it might have been something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">There there, old bean...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Poor Mrs Garrideb... </line>
<line speaker="Joan">...Of course I never meant for anything of the sort to happen, but... ...it was all my fault...wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">.........</line>
<line speaker="Joan">I take full responsibility. I let my anger get the better of me. ...I threw that book. ...And I threw the knife as well.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Joan">John, dear...</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">It's alright. I know.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks...what news of Mrs Garrideb?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">She's been taken to the infirmary. It would appear that today's events had left her in an especially flustered state. However, I believe she will recover in due course. There is no cause for concern.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, unbeknownst to themselves, they caused what could easily have been a terrible tragedy. They shall have to prepare themselves for the consequences of their actions.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There is some good news, however, My Lord. I have just had word from the hospital where the victim is being treated. Her condition is improving steadily, and the doctor believes she will regain consciousness soon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It's strange, we've been talking about the victim all this time, but we've never once met her.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">How wonderful! The woman is out of danger, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that is good news.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, Mr Soseki Natsume...</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Ah...um... Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">On behalf of my fellow countrymen, I would like to take this opportunity to beg your pardon, sir. You came from your distant Eastern homeland to study our great British culture... ...and have been repaid with immeasurable unkindness. Please accept our heartfelt apologies.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... No, it is me who should be begging your pardon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no, Mr Natsume...</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">That evening...when the young woman just collapsed on the pavement before my eyes... ...I, I jumped to the wrong conclusion again, in my confusion.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What conclusion, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">I was sure that the woman was dead.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, Constable Beate said the same thing, didn't he? He thought she had been killed, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I suppose she must have looked completely lifeless.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... It's been about a year since I arrived in Great Britain now. But I still can't get used to life here. I, I can't relax. I'm sure there are evil spirits lurking in the fog... Like they're haunting me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Poor Soseki-san... His imagination really has got the better of him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, poor man...</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">So when it happened... ...I thought the young woman had been taken by the fog spirits! I should never have dropped my books like that and run away. I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FOR HELP! FOR A DOCTOR! FOR THE POLICE! ......... Instead, I've managed to create a rift in the relationship of trust between our two empires. And for that...I am truly sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">One could indeed say that some sort of mischievous spirit has been at work here, I think. One that created a chain of unfortunate mishaps. We were befooled by this spirit and led to false conclusions. But thanks to Lord van Zieks, and our young lawyer here from the East... ...that chain has now been broken, and the spirit exorcised. ...I heartily commend you both.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In concluding this trial, I must ask one last time for your decisions regarding the defendant's culpability. Are you ready to present your findings to the court?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">As the foreman of the jury, I can assure you we've reached a fair and just conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I do declare the truth can be extremely cruel at times.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well, I didn't suspect the woman next to me, that's for sure!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Sitting in for the old bean whilst she's out of action, you know. But I know what her decision would be.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Does this mean I'll finally be able to get out of here and start work? ...Well, it's about time!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I say, I'll have a corker of a story to tell the grandchildren when I get home, won't I?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I hereby demand your final decisions. Mr Foreman!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Mr Soseki Natsume... I hereby pronounce you...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And finally, Mr Natsume...</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh! Yes, Lord, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You are now a free man once more. It is my hope that you will continue to further your education in British culture. ...And may you never again be brought before me!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsels. Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh, Locum!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Wait. You, you mean me?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">OF COURSE! Is there another locum here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Is there even one?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Compared to the original 'Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire', your name has become rather short, hasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What's wrong with using my actual name?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I am pleased! Mr Natsume is delighted!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Would it be so hard just to say that, then?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Locum, you did it! You saved me from the brink!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, what happened to the poor woman was in no way your fault, after all. I'm just glad everyone can see that now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...yes?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... I mean, as I said before...I have just never got used to life here in Great Britain. Every time I look over my shoulder, I see foreigners. I see towering brick buildings. And from high-up windows, I see them looking down on me, laughing, 'Look at that little hunchback!'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear, I'm sure it's all in your head, Mr Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki:...But! Today! You, locum lawyer, gave my gloom the boot! You stood firm behind that baronial bench, before all those babbling British! You battled to the bitter end, laying bare the baffling truth! And when I beheld the blinding fireworks among the beams of the Bailey's roof, I bellowed">Behold the Best Barrister ever Born!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, that's very flattering. And we're very pleased for you.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">This has given me a wonderful anecdote to recount to my old friends back in Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An, an anecdote? <thought>Is that what's to become of all my hard work?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Ah, there you are, my dear fellows!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I apologise for keeping you waiting. I rose late this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Mr Sholmes! What a pleasure to see you!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I see I am here not a moment too soon. A disaster has been averted, I'm glad to say!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The trial shall begin presently, Mr Naruhodo. And I wish you the very best of luck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's just finished.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What?! No! Then my haste was in vain?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">AAAAAARGH!!! It's...! It's...YOU! HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh? Have we met, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um, this is Mr Natsume. The man you had arrested, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, I see. I failed to recognise you at first. Our previous encounters have taken place in the gloom. Either of your bleak lodgings or that prison cell. I simply couldn't place that curious face, in the light.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Charming.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">This is all your fault...Herr Lock Sholmes! You're the reason I had to go through this terrible ordeal! I'm...I'm going to give you...a piece of my mind!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My apologies, sir, but I assure you, I have placed you now. You're the fellow who abandoned that poor young lady and ran off, are you not?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Had she been taken to hospital more urgently... ...I feel perhaps she would have regained consciousness by now.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But it was unavoidable, I'm sure. We are but human, after all. Anyone would have been shaken by such an experience.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... I...do feel very badly about how I behaved.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, never mind. Now then, what was it that you wanted to say to me, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... Nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Priceless! Oh, I am sorry, really, but... ...that was quite priceless.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Poor Soseki-san...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Still, on the bright side, you've had an extremely entertaining experience without paying a penny! And, it would seem...you were not even found guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">...But there is no bright side.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Whatever do you mean, Mr Natsume?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Even after this, I'm... I'm still cursed! ...By the spirits. And... AND NOW BY THE REAPER!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... <thought>Lord van Zieks...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">I haven't forgotten, you know! What facing that man in court means! Even if you're found not guilty...YOU'RE STILL DOOMED!!!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It, it will all be alright, Mr Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If the Reaper appears trying to make trouble... ...I will protect you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Much as I like being turned on my head, a bit of warning might be nice next time, Miss Susato. So, Mr Natsume...what do you intend to do now? You mentioned something about recounting your experiences to your friends back in Japan?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">......... Yes! I, I intend to return to my homeland soon.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">It has already been a year since I arrived here in Great Britain. I've visited universities, libraries, bookshops... I've been honoured with the tutelage of professors... I've learnt so much about the wealth of literature here, and the city it has shaped. And I've come to realise that it is my calling to sail home and tell my fellow countrymen about it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's very touching, Mr Natsume.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Or, in perhaps less veiled terms... ...you wish to withdraw halfway around the world to escape the terror of the Reaper's curse?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL! The more I learn of literature, the more this strange feeling claws at my insides. I feel compelled to return to my roots and attempt to pen a work of my own.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see. <thought>A work of literature by Soseki-san... Could be an interesting read.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And what about Miss Susato and yourself, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? What about us?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Will you return to Japan alongside your moustached compatriot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why would we?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A week has not yet passed since we arrived in London. And only now does it feel as though we have finally found our feet!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And...you are accommodated in a hotel at present, are you not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. But we need to find lodgings before it bankrupts us.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've calculated we can only afford another ten nights before our entire budget is exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Well then! You could take my lodgings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...The...windowless room?</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Ah, but what it lacks in windows, it more than makes up for with a floor, a ceiling AND walls.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Great.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">And of course, I'd be happy to leave behind the accursed evil spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! An evil spirit?!</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Oh yes. It tries to suffocate you while you sleep. It's, it's...an infallible wake-up call!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We'll...think about it, if that's alright.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Perhaps I can offer a more welcome alternative. Would you consider taking lodgings with me?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, a vacancy has conveniently presented itself. ...Though it is up in the attic, I might add.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you sure it isn't just a storage loft?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I spoke with the landlady this very morning on the matter of price. And Iris is cleaning the room as we speak. You must come at once. ...I presume you have no luggage to speak of?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, this is simply wonderful! What an honour! To be invited to taking lodgings in the great detective's office...'s attic! I'm...I'm too overcome for words!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...So suggesting we look elsewhere is out then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Then it's settled. Iris will prepare a welcome dinner this evening. And you must come too, Mr Natsume. I insist!</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">I...I...I...don't know what to say! But thank you! And yes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Wonderful! Then I'll go and complete the paperwork for your formal release, Mr Natsume! It shan't take long!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Somebody's happy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">...Locum. I, I knew that you wouldn't let me down. I'm truly delighted to have met you here in London.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Likewise, Mr Natsume. It's been a privilege meeting you, too. It's a shame that we're going to have to say goodbye so soon.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Well...I've come to realise that I belong in Japan. But, Locum! We'll meet again one day.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm sure. <thought>And hopefully by then, I'll be a successful lawyer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Soseki">Hopefully by then, I'll be a successful author.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, my dear fellow, our carriage appears to have arrived. Shall we go, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I've little doubt Mr Natsume will be released in time for dinner this evening.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And so... ...with Soseki-san's innocence successfully established... ...we rode with Mr Sholmes to what was to become our new home: 221B Baker Street.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Is to be our new office, yes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Our office...? I rather like the sound of that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Me, too! It's simply wonderful, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I hope you can see this, Kazuma. It's only a small step... ...but I'd like to think we're getting a little closer to your dream now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So, my dear fellows! Do you like the place?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Mr Sholmes... Yes, thank you so much.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's a delightful room, Mr Sholmes! I simply adore it!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Good, I'm pleased to hear it. Iris and I are delighted to welcome you.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I hope everyone's hungry! It's nearly time for dinner. We'll eat as soon as Mr Natsume arrives. We have a lot to celebrate!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Iris, you must let me help you!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright then, Susie, you can be in charge of the salad.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Splendid!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So, Mr Naruhodo, how does it feel? To have your own office in the capital?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's very exciting, actually. I can't help wondering what adventures await us.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Those were precisely my sentiments when I first established my office at these premises. ...Until I discovered the dark truth about the city of London, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">London is a glorious place, full of wonder, opportunity, prosperity and mirth. But the brightest of lights... ...casts the darkest of shadows.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shadows? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I believe you're well aware of the murkiness that lies behind London's facade already. So once again, Mr Naruhodo... ...welcome to London!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The witness's last statement is clearly at odds with this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And for heaven's sake, would you kindly desist from that wide-eyed panic-stricken look you are wont to wear!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...But it's the only panic-stricken look I know...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's just consider the implications of that statement for a moment, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What implications, Counsel? Nothing strikes me about it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...um...exactly! There's nothing striking about it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, what does strike me is your propensity for the inane, however.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... I need to clear my head and come at this again from a different angle.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That reveals a damning inconsistency, that last statement!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Damning, you say? As I look at you, Counsel, I see your trembling hand, your pallid expression and your perspiring brow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It seems to me THAT is the damning inconsistency here. With the misplaced confidence of your assertion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... He has a damning tongue...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You invite it, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's clearly something odd about that last statement made by the witness!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There is clearly something odd here indeed. Your behaviour, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Haha! Please, d-don't mind me...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That would be significantly easier if you would lower your hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I won't lower my hand until I prove my client's innocence! ...As long as it's quite quick.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I'm sorry, but as foreman of the jury, I have to object. That's complete nonsense!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I'm a banker, don't forget. An educated man! And there's no contradiction as far as I can see.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Quite so, Mr Foreman. I will not permit a whimsical attack against the good members of the jury, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...There was nothing whimsical about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's very important to listen carefully to every juror, Mr Naruhodo. Then you can decide where the contradictions really lie, if there are any.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to add, Constable?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Constable Beate!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">Hm? What? I, I thought I heard someone call out my name. Terrible, it was! Like a dying animal's wail!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...I'm, I'm not dying...am I?</thought> Erm...I was wondering if that last statement had any special significance to you?</line>
<line speaker="Roly">No, sah! Sorry to say not, sah. I mean, my Patricia fills my thoughts. Everything else is just noise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...He's wide awake now, then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to add, Mrs Beate?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Beate!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Oh! I didn't notice you there. Roly and I were lost in adoration for each other. I'm surprised you felt you could intrude, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm surprised you felt you could ignore the proceedings of the court. Tell me, did that last statement mean anything in particular to you?</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">Sorry, I can't help you. Roly fills my thoughts, and there's no space for anything else.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yet you manage to stop being besotted for long enough to tug him around by his scarf from time to time?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number one.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that last statement?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...Not really, no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... By the way, you never seem to look straight ahead. Always to one side or the other. Is...something troubling you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...Not really, no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's not going to tell me anything. Not really. No.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">And I'd appreciate it if you'd stop sticking your nose in where it's not wanted!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number two.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh! ...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that last statement?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">What I am particularly troubled by... ...is this mole. No amount of powder seems to cover it up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps you could give the trial as much attention as your mole?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If I may, juror number three...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh, can I help you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that last statement?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Erm, no, not really. Rather like how the accused wouldn't have had a reason to take the long way home from the bookshop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That wasn't even slightly what I asked.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">People look at me and think I'm an agreeable sort of fellow, but I think I'm quite contrary, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Good to know, when it's my job to try to change your mind.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number four.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh dearie me, what is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did that last statement trouble you in some way, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The only thing troubling me is that little Japanese lodger with the funny moustache. After all, when a lodger moves in, it's rather like having a new member of the family arrive.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It might be an idea to use the new member of the family's name then, instead of 'that little Japanese lodger'.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The point is, it's very difficult to know what would make a good welcome gift for the man. A book? Or something nice to eat?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Putting aside concerns about presents for the moment, could you maybe focus on the present concerns at hand?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five, is something troubling you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Eh? What's that now? Say it again! Go on!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...well... I said, 'Is something troubling you?'</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">No, not in particular, like.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Then what was that all about?</thought> As I was saying, did that last statement trouble you in some way?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Look! If there's one thing troubling me, it's where I'm gonna earn the pennies today, alright? That's it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please earn your keep as a juror first, and actually listen to what's being said in the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say, juror number six?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hm? Sorry, what was that? You'll have to speak up, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>...I would love to know who picked this rag-tag panel of jurors.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oi! I heard that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Perhaps you could apply that selective hearing to the proceedings here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mrs Garrideb.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">Dearie me, what is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did that last statement trouble you in some way, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Joan">The only thing troubling me is that little Japanese lodger with the funny moustache. After all, when a lodger moves in, it's rather like having a new member of the family arrive.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It might be an idea to use the new member of the family's name then, instead of 'that little Japanese lodger'.</line>
<line speaker="Joan">The point is, it's very difficult to know what would make a good welcome gift for the man. A book? Or something nice to eat?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Putting aside concerns about presents for the moment, could you maybe focus on the present concerns at hand?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Have to insist on Lieutenant Garrideb in this setting, I'm afraid. Chain of command, and all that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Try again, old chap.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I was wondering if you had anything to say about that last statement...Lieutenant.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">No, can't say I did. Why? Did I look as though I had something to say about it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No. You seemed completely oblivious.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Well, when you reach my age, an awful lot passes you by, you know. In one ear, out the other.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well, if you could plug one ear up just for the duration of the trial, Lieutenant, that would be very helpful.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That will do! ...I believe we've seen quite enough here. According to the powers vested in me by Her Majesty the Queen, I declare no further examination necessary. As such, I shall be requesting the final decisions of the members of the jury. Are you all ready, Mr Foreman?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Certainly, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then please announce your findings to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hereby declare the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I applaud your considered and expedient deliberations. Court is adjourned!</line>
