<title>At the Market</title>
<line speaker="Maya">It's as busy as ever here today!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Hey look, Maya! The usual suspects are all here!</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Ah...it's you lot again! It's been a while.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hey there, Mary. How have you and your goats been?</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Couldn't be better! How about a little taste of some scrumptious goat's milk? On the house, of course!</line>
<line speaker="Kira">Oh, look...if it isn't my favourite customers. Welcome back to Labyrinthia!</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Hello again, Miss Kira. I see you've gone back to selling flowers.</line>
<line speaker="Kira">That's right! Despite the long days and the boss breathing down my neck, it's pretty relaxing. Now, could I interest you fine folks... in some positively pretty posies?</line>
<line speaker="Layton">By all means, Miss Kira. That sounds delightful.</line>
<line speaker="Espella">Oh... I've just noticed! You're not wearing glasses again today, Miss Kira.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now that you mention it... You're right, Espella.</line>
<line speaker="Kira">Ah...yeah, well... I think I must've dropped them somewhere. AGAIN. Glasses like that don't come cheap. It took me MONTHS to save up for those!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Kira">Well, they have a pure gold frame and the lenses are made of diamond. Not. Cheap.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Seriously...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wait... I know! Maybe they fell into Mary's milk bucket again! SPLOOSH, right?</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Ah, yes...my milk bucket. Actually, that bucket's also gone missing. I seem to have misplaced it somewhere...</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Hmm... The plot thickens...</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Yes, well... At least there was no precious milk in it today.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hey, look! That's Knightle over there! Hey there, Knightle! How's the knightly lifestyle?</line>
<line speaker="Knightle">Don't be absurd! That name..."Knightle"...is but a relic of the long-forgotten past!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Luke">If I remember rightly, you gave up wanting to be a knight and started up as a potato seller instead... Which is when you changed your name to Mr Spudley, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Spudley?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But after that, a mysterious explosion destroyed your potato stall and baked all your potatoes. And finally, while you weren't sure what to do with your life, you adopted the name Whatley...</line>
<line speaker="Knightle">Knightle, Spudley, Whatley... Those names serve as nothing more than reminders of the past. ...With great purpose, I have cast aside such memories and have bid goodbye to the problems of the past. That's right! I have already found a much more fitting new name! A name I have since assumed!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Oh, really? So, um...what "-ley" have you come up with this time?</line>
<line speaker="Knightle">The name by which I shall henceforth be known, is... Ignitely!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um... Where the heck did "Ignitely" come from?</line>
<line speaker="Knightle">A man's name should express his heart... and my heart is full of fire. Hence, Ignitely! "Fearless and full of fire"... At last, a worthy name to express my true character!</line>
<line speaker="Layton">"Ignitely", you say? Well, it certainly is...intense.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">It kind of makes me think more of sparks and explosions...</line>
<line speaker="Knightle">Well, from the outset... "Knightle" failed to really stoke my fire, if you know what I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm, err...not sure I do know...or want to...</line>
<line speaker="Knightle">A young man yearning to become a knight... hence the name "Knightle". No matter how you look at it, that name conveys a certain...lack of imagination.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">No kidding... I guess you have a point.</line>
<line speaker="Espella">I'm sorry, but I must beg to differ. I'm sure the developers put a lot of thought into the names they came up with.</line>
<line speaker="???">Mary:</line>
<line speaker="Espella">...What about it?</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Everyone knows the rhyme: "Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow..." But tell me...what's that got to do with me? My fluffy little Snowy-kins is a gorgeous white goat, not a lamb! I mean, they didn't even think to get the right animal! What poppycock!</line>
<line speaker="Kira">Kira:</line>
<line speaker="Espella">M-Miss Kira?</line>
<line speaker="Kira">I mean, yeah, I played the role of a killer in that trial and everything. But to actually name me Kira? As soon as anyone hears my name, the first thing they'll think is "GUILTY"! It's so unfair!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Hmm... I see what you mean...</line>
<line speaker="Layton">I suppose it doesn't sound like a great deal of time went into the creation of such names... What do you think, Espella?</line>
<line speaker="Espella">Well, when you put it like that... I guess... even the name Espella seems a little... obvious.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ha...well, I guess we're not meant to think all that hard about it!</line>
<line speaker="Layton">...At any rate, I hear the first witch trial, in which these people all appeared as witnesses, was the first scenario written for this game. I suppose you could call it a trial run.</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Wow, really?</line>
<line speaker="Layton">That's right. Apparently, at the time, simple "placeholder" names were given to all the characters. Although, curiously enough, many of these placeholder names seem to have stuck.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Once those names stuck, I guess the characters were stuck with those names. Sounds familiar somehow... Sometimes, once you get to know a character by a certain name, no other name seems to sit so well.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's why it's so important to start off on the right foot!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">I think she's right, Mr Wright!</line>
<line speaker="???">???:</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">how about hearin' what I got to say!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Ah! Where did you come from?! ........................</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Talkin' about bad namin'... Mine's gotta be the worst of all, ain't it?! I mean... just for convenience, they gave me a name that sounded just like that darn spell "Amere"!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh, sure... Your name's "Emeer"...is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">That's me! But you guys got all those cool soundin' nicknames... "Sir Blue Knight", "Sir Dark Hat", that sorta thing. "Punchen" says "I ain't no pushover and I'll punch ya if y'think so"! "Baug" is, err... I read it off a bottle at Rouge's, I think...</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Professor, is it me...or does "Punchenbaug" sound an awful lot like punching b-</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Hold on, my boy. A gentleman should never ruin someone's dreams without a reason.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">By the way, er...mister.</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">What is it, Bluey?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If I remember correctly...you were the one that took the professor's golden arm, right? After that, I sort of figured you'd have to lose the, uhm, shiny look and go back to how you looked before...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hey, that's right! How come you still look like a blinged-up, festive palm tree?</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Don't tell me... I bet you paid another visit to the pawnbroker with some "five-finger-discounted" items, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Wh-whaddya mean "five-finger-discounted"? I, Emeer Punchenbaug I, wouldn't dream of takin' someone else's possessions!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>Where have I heard that before...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Let me tell ya somethin'... It was, erm... It was elves that helped me out!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Elves helped you?</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Tha's right! When I'm fast asleep at night, the elves sometimes leave me little gifts... Y'get what I mean?! Cute little elves, kinda like the ones in this puzzle here...</line>
<line speaker="Picarats">N/A</line>
<line speaker="Notes">N/A</line>
<line speaker="Additional dialogue">N/A</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Well... forgetting your elves for one moment, Snowy and I have something we'd like to ask you... I'm looking at you, you gaudy, oversized bauble-head! Tell me... you wouldn't happen to know where my milk bucket is, now would you?! Don't you tell me you've gone and sold it!</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Me? Are ya nuts?! I'm pure as the driven...snow!</line>
<line speaker="Layton">...Is that so?</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Sure it is! An' anyway, let ME ask you... Does such a foul-tastin' liquid even deserve to be called milk?!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">That stuff tasted more like...y'know... ...Almost like drinkin' a darn bucket of white paint!</line>
<line speaker="Mary">............</line>
<line speaker="Layton">............</line>
<line speaker="Luke">............</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">............ No way...</line>
<line speaker="Mary">Well now, there's a good reason for that. Today, my milk bucket... was filled with white paint, you see. I was planning to repaint the fences around the farm.</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">............ Uh...</line>
<line speaker="Kira">Inside that milk bucket, you didn't happen to find... my glasses, did you?! Don't tell me they really were in there!</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Wh-what would I want with your glasses?! Me vision's 20/20!</line>
<line speaker="Layton">...Unfortunately, your credibility is looking a little more cloudy.</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Well! Let me ask ya this... Can you really go around callin' two diamonds surrounded by pure gold a pair of "glasses"?!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">Nope, I ain't havin' any of it! Those things were no glasses. There's only one word for somethin' like that, an' that's treasure! Treasure waitin' to be sold at the best possible price!</line>
<line speaker="Kira">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............</line>
<line speaker="Maya">............</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">............ Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Mary">You...you...you...scoundrel!</line>
<line speaker="Some Guy">C'mon, what's it matter anyway, eh? One thing I can say is this: on account of the paint I drank, deep down inside... I really am pure as the driven snow!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah, well... I think you'd better go and get those glasses back right away.</line>
<line speaker="Kira">Yes, you're right... I'll go and have a word with Mr Price...</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Hmm... I'm not entirely sure it will be that easy... A pawnbroker with a name like Price... Something tells me he may not be the type to hand over anything for free.</line>
