<title>The Great Special Trial</title>
<line speaker="???">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um...what are you doing, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Miss Susato, well... ...as I'm sure you saw, I was getting into the swing of things!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Into the swing...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We're going to meet someone amazing in next year's 'The Great Ace Attorney' game, you know. But I think the person in question is going to make a brief advance debut here tonight. And as a proud young Japanese man, I want to show my fellow star what I can do!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a wonderful attitude!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Still...it's a bit unsettling, isn't it? At night...in this big courtroom, I mean...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're probably still feeling scared after seeing the Hall of Horrors at the Tower of London earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...you've researched all the best places to visit in the capital, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've already planned our itinerary for tomorrow, which includes an even more terrifying exhibition!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I also - shock, horror - enjoy non-terrifying sights...</thought> By the way, do you, um...hear something?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, they do say that the Old Bailey is haunted...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't! Please! I'm still on tenterhooks after all the talk of ghosts we heard at the Tower earlier!</line>
<line speaker="???">AAA-CHOO!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">AAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Who's, who's there?!</line>
<line speaker="???">Of course... Yes, I see it all laid out before me now. The truth...illuminated once again by another great deduction. You, sir, are without doubt... a murdered Italian chef!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="???">Dear me. Unaware of your own passing, roaming the corridors and halls of the great courthouse...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="???">When you've been killed, my dear fellow, it is customary...to drop dead!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huuuuuuh?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">AAAAAAAAAGH! You're... You're... You're the world-famous great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, you've heard of me?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! I'm a devoted follower of your wonderful exploits! 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' is delivered all the way to Japan by steamship!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'Elementary, my dear Wilson!'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! That's exactly what I read in the stories!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! That too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are the stories full of gross delusions, too? Like the notion that I'm dead...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'A great deduction and a gross delusion are but a hairbreadth apart!'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... That isn't what I read in the stories.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Where exactly did you get the idea that I'm a murdered Italian chef?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">An excellent question...my dear cordon bleu. So...shall we begin? Allow me to present Herlock Sholmes's logic and reasoning! Earlier today I received a telegram with details of a case that prompted me to come here. 'An Italian chef has been murdered in the Old Bailey.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An Italian chef...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In the Old Bailey...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite! I have a thorough grounding in the Japanese language. There can be no mistake in my translation! And I immediately observed the foreign blade at your side. Clearly to slice carpaccio. The star-patterned buttons of your jacket - an unmistakable mark of your skill. And your Eastern appearance might fool a layman, but not a well-travelled detective. And the blood-stained dagger in your back is a sure sign that you're no longer of this world. Accordingly, there can be no doubt. You are Italian! You are a chef! And you are dead! They do say...that the Old Bailey is haunted, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That 'great deduction'... ...was blatantly cooked up on the spot to fit the telegram!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But my dear fellow, you have a knife lodged in your spine. What other explanation can there be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, this? This is just a plaything.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We bought them on a whim at the Hall of Horrors exhibition at the Tower of London.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... Don't tell me... ...that you're about to make some preposterous claim about not being dead at all?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'M ALIVE!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But... ...if you're not a murdered Italian chef, then who the devil are you?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And I am Susato Mikotoba... ...Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Or so you say...to mask your actual identity. The truth is you're an Italian chef! You cannot deny there's at least a distinct possibility of it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There isn't!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um, Mr Sholmes...might I have a look at the telegram you received?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-Wait, this... You only have to read the first word to see... there's a clear inconsistency!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There is?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look more closely. It doesn't say 'Old Bailey' at all... It says 'Old Daily'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Old...Daily?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, of course! There is an Italian restaurant called 'Old Daily' just around the corner. Named after the terrifying army cannon they fire every day to bake their famous 'pizza'.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are, are you sure?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes. Clearly... ...your interpretation of the crime scene written in that telegram was a complete mistranslation!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">GAAAAAAAAARGH!!! ...What business does a Japanese telegram have in a British escapade anyway...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And that brings us to the end of this little tale. But we shall see you soon in the game, I'm sure!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You may even be astounded by more of my great deductions!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you'll certainly be astounded by the great delicacies we're cooking up for the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In that case, my dear cordon bleu, a dish of your finest carpaccio, if you please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">THAT WAS A METAPHOR!</line>
