Our project repo for our Spring 2024 DIGIT 210 project, featuring the Ace Attorney franchise.

Our goal is to gather a uniform, probably script-like text file for the ace attorney games
(Undecided yet which games to study, possibly first trilogy, but we could do the entire
series as well...) and then  feed theses scripts to a text-generation AI model, with
the goal of generating a new case/mystery set in the Ace Attorney universe.

Ace attorney mysteries are notoriously obscure and often kind of silly. Our hope is that
the model generates something in a similar vein, incomprehensible or downright comedic, both
to celebrate the series and to prove that text-generative bots aren't on par with real
writers.

We would like to visualize 'our' 'creation' using objection.lol, an online creation tool
that fans use to create memes or parodies of the games.
